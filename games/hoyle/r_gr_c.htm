        backgrounds, card designs, music, and difficulty to meet
        your desire. The music choices range from classical to
        &quot;mellow&quot; (look out John Tesh) to the funkified
        &quot;urban&quot; (get down, get down...). An added
        surprise is the &quot;Card Flip&quot; game. This is a
        mindless exercise involving flipping cards into different
        objects. Yet somehow this becomes addictive as well
        (maybe it was the fever or something). </td>

        the Hoyle series manages to break through the humdrum
        cloud of PC card gaming by offering well- planned games.
