        order to create necessary buildings and attain higher
        Tech Levels, where better units and special features are
        available. For example, you can't use the radar (overhead
        mini-map) to scroll around until your Outpost/Clan Hall
        reaches Tech Level 2. <p><img

        Krush has networking in all the right places. Two people

        alliances can be created as you would expect, but in a
        welcome twist, air strikes and sabotage can be executed
        without breaking an alliance. This allows for gray areas

        <p><img src="../../images/spacer.gif" width="27"
        height="15">*In the beginning, the Survivors are a little
        bit easier to manage than the Evolved because the
        Survivors only need one building (the Machine Shop) to
        produce all units, as compared to the Evolved's two
        necessary buildings (Blacksmith and Beast Enclosure). <a
