        1995's smash Command &amp; Conquer, Westwood Studios' Red
        Alert is an action-strategy game set in an
        alternate-history WWII that pits United Europe against a
        Stalinist Soviet empire. For the uninitiated, Red Alert's
        gamplay centers on the real-time managment of dozens of
        individual units in the combat zone: foot soldiers,
        grenadiers, engineers, tanks, jeeps, aircraft,
        submarines, gun batteries, guard dogs, medics, and the
        all-important scavenger units, which roam </td>

        battlefield more or less autonomously, scooping up fuel
        and resources to produce wartime revenue. Units are
        commanded by a click-and-send scheme: One mouse click on
        a unit selects it, and the next click determines where it
        moves or what it attacks, repairs, heals, spies on, or
        avoids. <p><img src="../../images/spacer.gif" width="27"

        trouble. Meanwhile, your six scouts have died miserably -
        the first two having been disemboweled by guard dogs, the

        from a massive Tesla coil emplacement. And as you're
