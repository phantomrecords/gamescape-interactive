<font size="3">&quot;</font>What can I say about Diablo that
hasn't become completely obvious over few weeks after it's
release. The number of websites dedicated to this game is
astonishing given that game like Diablo (role-playing games) were
supposed to be dying out. <font size="3">[</font><a

</font>If I didn't know any better I'd say Diablo was the most
amasing new game concept to come out since SimCity or PacMan. But
I know that it isn't. Games like this have been around for ages
both as computer games and as games in the arcade like Gauntlet.
But what sets Diablo apart from all of those is attention to
detail. <font size="3">[</font><a href="diablo_pr.htm"><font

Review</font><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
&quot;</font>Diablo took me completely by surprise. Naturally I
have become hopelessly addicted to Blizzard's Warcraft series. I
expected that sort of real-time speed and strategy that makes
Warcraft II such a classic. Since you're not directing units of
troops, but one character, I was ready for something arcade-ish.
Little did I realise that I would soon sink my teeth into a game
that delivers the entertainment of a good long-haul Role-Playing
Game. <font size="3">[</font><a href="diablo_pr.htm"><font

town as a base of operations, slowly infiltrate a cursed
cathedral. The cathedral is randomly generated each time you
start a new game, but there is an automap to help you keep track
of your current dungeon. The townspeople will occasionally assign
you tasks (there's a quest log so you can keep your mission in
mind), but you can explore the dungeon on your own time if you
wish, gathering treasure and building up your character for the
real fight that you know is waiting for you on the lower levels.
That's right. It's a good old-fashioned dungeon-crawl, but put
together with Blizzard's style and talent.<font

Review</font><br>
<font size="3">&quot;</font>If you've played Diablo, reading my
review will simply be confirmation of something you already know:
this game rocks. We here at Gamezilla try to avoid such phrases
because they tend to get overused and fail to convey real
specifics. But in this case, I can't avoid saying it: Diablo
truly rocks. If you know this, your time is probably better spent
playing Diablo than reading this...if you want to see what all
the fuss is about, I'll do my best to clue you in. Diablo, in my
opinion, is the first completely successful combination of
role-playing and real-time action to hit the PC. There have been
successful RPGs and great action games, but never a combination
that played so easily and offered so much as Diablo. Until now,
RPGs were basically a niche, mostly bought and played by diehard
Dungeons and Dragons types. Similarly, action games have
traditionally been focused on inducing an adrenaline rush, with
only the occasional half-hearted attempts to incorporate
role-playing or character-building elements.<font size="3">&quot;<br>

Review</font> <font size="4" face="Arial">(talks about playing
Diablo in multiplayer mode)</font><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
</font><font size="3">&quot;</font>Let me start out by saying
that Diablo is the first game that I would even consider playing
only multiplayer, without even trying the single player version.
I do not say this because single player is somehow flawed or less
than excellent. In fact, I heartily enjoyed single player, and
would have been pretty satisfied by this game even if it had no
multiplayer abilities. However, the multiplayer aspect of this
game has everything in the single player game, except for the
random quest generator (why not?) and the option to save and
restore as you please (keeping down on the level of multiplayer
cheating). But then again, you already know how good this game
is, and that is why you are reading this article. Let me get down
to business, and since the focal point for all this gaming action
is Battle.net (over 100,000 gamers use it already!), I will
center my suggestions on that little online gaming community,
although most of them apply to multiplaying in general.<font

Player Review</font><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
</font>&quot;<em><strong>9.5 out of 10. </strong></em>Diablo is
one awesome game. The graphics are nice, (you can zoom in to see
more gore) the game play is perfect, and the strategy is there
too. But the thing that really makes Diablo a winner in my
opinion is the game play. The difficulty curve of the dungeon
levels is just right - when you've cleared the first level, your
character is strong enough for the second level. Blizzard have
recognised that this is the most important aspect of a
dungeon-exploring RPG, and thye've got it just right. Its still
enough of a challenge for you to require constant saving, and
maybe even to start a new game (equipment and experience carried
over) to redo those first levels to make your character stronger
for the later levels. Don't pass over this game until you've
experienced the IMMENSE satisfaction received from splatting
those skeletons.&quot;</p>
