<b>Q: Where did you get the inspiration for </b><b><i>Crusader?</i></b>
<br>
<b>A:</b> Back in 1980, when I was about 12 years old, I was
playing computer games on my dad's Apple II at work. There was
one I really liked called <i>Castle Wolfenstein</i>, which was
the predecessor of the 3D game eventually done by id Software. It
was in 2D and arcade style &#151; you'd wander around, pick up
things like guns, grenades and bullet-proof vests, and explore
rooms, and there was even some rudimentary German speech.
Although the technology was simple, the game was exceptionally
fun to play. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Q: Was </b><b><i>Crusader</i></b><b> a
hard idea to sell?</b> <br>
<b>A:</b> I was asked if there had ever been any similar games on
the market. It's ironic, but these days, there are only a handful
of those kinds of games still being made. I said it was
reminiscent of games like <i>Relentless: Twinsen's Adventure</i>&trade;
and <i>Syndicate</i>&trade;, but that there were no games really
like it. Maybe it's not a totally original concept, but it is a
very original implementation. The difference is, I was going to
take advantage of new, state-of-the-art technology, utilizing
things like SVGA graphics and the full power of the Pentium
processor &#151; all the bells and whistles. The relentless
action and the game design in general was a definite departure
from the games that ORIGIN has traditionally done. In the end,
though, people were sold on the idea that regardless of the genre
of the game, it would still maintain ORIGIN's high standards ...
that it would still be at the top of its class. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Q: Describe your game designing process.</b>
<br>
<b>A:</b> I'm sure it varies from person to person. For me, I
identified things I would enjoy in a game &#151; like a large
selection of weapons and usable objects, burning bodies, lots of
different ways to kill enemies, detailed art, an environment that
could enhance the visual realism of the fire fights, and a
variety of terrain types &#151; and worked them into the design.
I had just worked with Richard Garriott on <i>Ultima</i>® <i>VIII</i>.
I approached him with the concept for <i>Crusader</i>. He had
faith in the project and gave me the go-ahead. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Q: Who else worked on the project?</b> <br>
<b>A:</b> I looked for a lead designer and lead artist and was
lucky to find Mark Vittek and Beverly Garland for those roles. I
think they did a phenomenal job. Jason Ely developed the music
system on his own time at home. It's a digital instrument format
that does what most of the higher end sound cards do with wave
table synthesis. The big benefit is even people with $40 cards
get phenomenal sound. People with general MIDI also get good
sound, although we're not fully utilizing their hardware. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Q: Now that it's out, how do you think
it turned out?</b> <br>
<b>A:</b> About six months from the end of the project, I asked
myself, &quot;Is this game fun?&quot; It's amazing how much
objectivity you can lose while creating a game. At this point,
the overall reaction has been very positive, so I know I've come
up with something other people are enjoying. It's reassuring that
a lot of people have bought into a lot of the same concepts that
have gone through my head before. From a programmer's
perspective, I look back on <i>Crusader</i> thinking to myself,
&quot;If only I had added this or that little feature.&quot; It's
great to strive for perfection, but in reality you have to shoot
for realistic goals and put something out. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Q: Are there any parallels between the
game and real life at ORIGIN?</b> <br>
<b>A:</b> One of the floors in the game is reminiscent of a floor
in our old building, thanks to Melanie Green [<i>Now Melody
Yenawine &#151; Editor</i>]. There are a couple of people's names
who made it in. My favorite number is 16, which pops up here and
there &#151; there are 16 screen shots on the back of the box.
Eric Wilmar created a secret room that's modeled after his room
at home &#151; it contains a Commodore® 64. He also put in a
picture with a pink background that's actually a touched up
picture of Jason Ely from his high school yearbook. There are
more hidden things. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Q: What's in store for the future?</b> <br>
<b>A:</b> This basic concept can obviously be expanded into a
variety of different environments. I want to make other games
that adhere to the same attention to detail. The important thing
is ACTION, ACTION, ACTION! It might seem strange, but I don't
particularly care for pure shoot-em-ups...the action games I want
to do will always reward intelligence. Whether this is due to a
strategic element, a variety of ways to accomplish your
objectives, or whatever, the important thing is that you have to
involve the player &#151; or at least give him the opportunity to
interact on more than a purely reflex-based level. The exact
mixture of these different elements varies according to the game.
For a game like <i>Crusader</i>, players should always be
inundated with new things &#151; monsters, puzzles, maps. I don't
want to create a game that leaves people wandering around with
nothing to do &#151; except to maybe find one red keycard &#151;
once they've killed all the enemies in a maze. That's why most of
the maps in <i>Crusader</i> are linear. I won't be lead
programmer again &#151; there are only 24 hours in a day ... I
will continue to direct, and will become the game's producer.
Jason Ely, the game's other system programmer, will become lead
programmer, and Terry Manderfeld will become the lead artist.
Mark Vittek will remain the game's lead designer. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Q: So </b><b><i>Crusader</i></b><b>
doesn't end here?</b> <br>
<b>A:</b> For starters, I'd like to do an additional missions
disk with new flicks, weapons, terrain, and enemies. [</font><a
href="http://www.origin.ea.com/english/prod-info/pc-cd/current-titles/noregret/index.html"><font
face="Arial">Crusader: No Regret,</font></a><font face="Arial"><i>
a self-contained game using the original </i>Crusader<i> engine,
was released August, 199 6 &#151; Editor</i>] But I'd like to see
a <i>Crusader II</i> with a 100 percent new engine and rewrite.
This game was a learning experience &#151; it was my first
independent project. Now that we have implemented the technology,
I think we now have a strong idea of where it can go in the
future. For example, from the start, we'd make the engine
multi-player via modem or network. The background art will be
texture mapped to allow for light sourcing and rotation of the
room &#151; you'll be able to enter a room wearing infrared
goggles, take out the lights, and have an advantage over an enemy
who can't see in the dark. The art quality will get even better,
the map will be able to be rotated on 90-degree increments,
enemies will become far more devious and intelligent, there will
be more variety in the mechs, weapons, and usable items, the
Crusader and other characters will have more special maneuvers
that they can perform, and a whole host of other improvements. I
would also like to add some more flicks so that players can get
more feedback when they accomplish their missions and have more
branching in the storyline to allow for different outcomes. We
can use more sophisticated drawing routines that will allow for a
wide variety of interesting visual effects, but the character
animation will likely remain bitmapped. A primary issue will be
to conserve a lot more art space so that it will perform better
on machines with a minimal amount of RAM. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Q: Are there any patches in the works
for this version?</b> <br>
<b>A:</b> We'll likely do one for Gravis Ultrasound and the
Gravis Ultrapad. [<i>Patches available at </i></font><a
href="http://www.origin.ea.com/english/prod-support/crusader/index.html"><font
face="Arial"><i>http://www.origin.ea.com/english/prod-support/crusader/index.html
</i></font></a><font face="Arial"><i>&#151; Editor</i>] Depending
on our feedback, we'll also do joystick support. If enough people
want it, we'll give it to them. If players have really good
ideas, we'll implement them &#151; especially in the next
version, where we can add people's ideas for new weapons and
enemies. I would really like to hear from people who have played
the game ... what they liked, what they disliked, what they wish
would show up in a sequel. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Q: Will this version come out for other
platforms?</b> <br>
<b>A:</b> We're hoping to get </font><a

designing games?</b> <br>
