        my cynicism, I was actually quite impressed when I loaded
        it up. Rather than the anonymous tunnels and halls of so
        many 3D games, <i>Realms</i>for a more <i>3D </i>have
        gone realistic approach, with cities, moonbases, and
        everything. Granted, did have levels supposedly set <b><i>Doom</i></b>
        in cities, and bases, and the like, but they really
        didn't look anything like your average metropolis. <b><i>DN3D</i></b>skyscrapers,
        has huge sewers , a cinema, and even </p>

        <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="190" height="346">an
        adult bookstore. And that's just in the first episode.
        Later levels bring a karaoke club, a flooded city, subway
        station, and much more. Even the moonbase comes complete
        with sprawling corridors, and reactor rooms. <p><b>Ivor

        going around said places. There's not much of a plot..
        there seldom is in most 3D games. Usually enough to
        justify alien/demon bottom. Duke </p>

        is the hero of the piece, a muscled, chauvenistic
        gun-toting bloke, and who has just returned from his last
        platform adventure to find the earth being taken over by
        yet another nasty alien race. In fact, as soon as sees
        home, his ship is taken out by a rocket fired from alien
        or aliens unknown. He ejects, landing on a city rooftop,
        with only a pistol for company. Quicker than you can say
        'I'm so hard I can watch &quot;Tonight with Richard and
        Judy&quot; without topping myself', he's tooled up and
        heading into the fray. <a href="r_gsdm_b.htm"><img
