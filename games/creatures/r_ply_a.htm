        install the software, you must select an egg from the
        &quot;hatchery&quot; (a floppy disk that contains six
        eggs - once these are gone, they're gone). Then, the egg
        is placed in the Norn's world, a large environment
        similar to a fish-tank or a big hamster cage and filled
        with food, toys, dangerous things and even a nasty
        critter (the Grendel) - all of which your Norn can
        interact with. You can even teach your Norns to speak, by
        associating words with various objects and actions and
        repeatedly saying </td>

        This can be maliciously fun, as there is nothing to stop
        you teaching your Norn rude words instead of
        &quot;pull&quot;, &quot;sleep&quot;, &quot;carrot&quot;
        etc, which provides many hours of immature amusement as
        your Norns describe simple and innocuous actions with all
        the charm and grace of a HGV truck driver.<p><img

        teaching them to play with all the toys and interactive
        objects (pianos, drums, slide projectors - the list is
        long and varied). There is no doubt that the programming
        involved is an amazing feat, and that the claims
        Creatures made are actually correct - these little things
        have a (a-)life of their own...<p><img
