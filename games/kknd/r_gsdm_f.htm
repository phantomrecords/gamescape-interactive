        troops. <i>Westwood</i> weakened, but didn't completely
        crush, the barrier that most real-time strategy
        programmer's face when trying to get troops to move to a
        place specified by the player, and actually <i>get</i>
        there! <b><i>KKnD</i></b> seems to have taken a slight
        step backwards. I'd tell a group of 10 or so to get to
        the other side of a bridge or through a narrow valley,

        they make it? Maybe. Eventually. They'd jump about, lots
        of reversing, getting out of each other's way - they
        couldn't seem to figure if they simply got into
        single-file things would go a lot quicker. Instead they
        all go at once, all bump into one another, all say,

        the very <i>worst</i> part of your own team's AI - simply
        put, they're dumb! It seems impossible to position a
        group of troops to defend a building in a place where
        they will <i>all</i> defend sensibly. All </p>

        units seem unaware of anything that's going on around
        them. If an enemy comes along and attacks the first unit
        it comes across, then that soldier will fight back, but
        what will the 20 standing literally <i>one</i> meter away
        do? Sweet FA, basically. Check their watches, and talk
        about the weather. This is very frustrating because it
        usually has you frantically scanning all over the map,
        being forced to manually tell every unit to advance and
        attack when their teammates are being pummelled into the
        dirt.<p><img src="../../images/spacer.gif" width="27"
