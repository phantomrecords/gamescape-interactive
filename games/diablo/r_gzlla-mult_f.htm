        trade an item that you don't need or can't use for
        something that fits you better. For instance, if a Rogue
        (who usually uses long-range weapons) finds a fabulous
        sword, she can trade it for a ring, bow, armor, or other
        such item that is more fitting. Simply find someone in
        the channels that is interested in your item and has
        something you want in return, then form a game and trade.

        of multiplayer games. Opinions vary on the value/honor of
        PKillers, but there is rarely any argument about thieves.
        PKillers are characters that hunt down other players
        (usually in cooperative games), and usually pick on
        unsuspecting characters weaker than them. While PKilling
        (or PKing for short) is not forbidden or even discouraged
        by Blizzard, most players are strongly against it. On the
        other hand, players that just want to try out their stuff
        will often agree with another player on a </td>

        game, with the stakes for the winner decided ahead of
        time. Deathmatching is very different from Pkilling due
        to the large degree of cowardice and dishonesty that is
        generally associated with the latter.<p><img

        best way to prevent being PKilled is to travel in groups
        you trust, and only give out the password of your game to
        others that you can trust. On the other hand, a totally
        open game can be a good way to meet others. One of the
