<p><font color="#00FFFF" size="3" face="Arial">Now I'm not in the
habit of hyping up games but I'll certainly hype this one~!
That's because the demo was surprisingly fun. It all started on a
Saturday night after I saw the commercial. I figured &quot;what a
silly name&quot; but then I thought &quot;I don't have a social
life either.&quot; So I jumped on the Internet, typed in a search
and wham... I was at www.tombraider.com and the demo was
downloading.</font></p>

<p><font color="#00FFFF" size="3" face="Arial">It started off a
bit confusing but naturally hadn't read the instructions. Does
anyone? It took some time but after pressing F1 to get the screen
res high and SPACE to draws the guns, everything was cool! </font></p>

<p><font color="#00FFFF" size="3" face="Arial">Lara, the chick in
the flics, is quite on to it! She'll aim her guns at whatever is
a threat. That's her way of telling the player &quot;fire you
imbecile or I'll get clobbered!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font color="#00FFFF" size="3" face="Arial">She'll also think
about her surroundings before she reacts. For example there's a
part in the demo where she gets stuck in a room. There's a stone
cube in the wall that must be moveable somehow. But how?</font></p>

<p><font color="#00FFFF" size="3" face="Arial">No buttons, no
switches, there ain't nothing... Just you and the stone. So I
started pressing the CTRL key while facing the door... and then <em>CTRL-UP
</em>and <em><strong>pouf! </strong></em>Without a pause, Lara
hunched down, got in a cool stance, and threw her weight at the
stone, heaving and pushing bit by bit until it gave way. The
sound effects were cool and I was free!</font></p>

<p><font color="#00FFFF" size="3" face="Arial">But wait there's
more... </font></p>

<p><font color="#00FFFF" size="3" face="Arial">Swimming is
definitely the best... The developers animated it so well that I
want to say things like &quot;dead on&quot; and
&quot;awesome&quot; but I might sound like a TV ad. Can't have
that so I'll let the demo speak for itself... I trust you'll see
where I'm coming from once you've played it!</font></p>

<p><font color="#00FFFF" size="3" face="Arial">Ta...!</font></p>
