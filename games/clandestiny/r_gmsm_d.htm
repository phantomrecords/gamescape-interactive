        The background music is often comprised of bagpipes, of
        course, which does help with the games &quot;regional
        authenticity.&quot; I do have to comment on the cute
        movie bits that occur periodically which help to enhance
        the adventure's playability, but they do not make the
        game. </font></p>

        However, playing at the average intelligence level,
        people under fifteen I think would be unable to grasp
        many of the puzzles. Another unfavorable aspect of this
        game is the constant reoccurrence of Fergus, the castle's
        handyman, who keeps popping up at the entrance of every
        door, to tell your character that he has the key to the
        door--the knowledge. Enough already, a couple of
        appearances would suffice. </font></td>

        can receive four before the computer will solve the
        puzzle for you), rarely is it a helpful hint, but another
        puzzle. Shouldn't a hint be a helpful and reasonably easy
