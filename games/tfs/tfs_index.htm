        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Terminator
        Future Shock is still, in my opinion, the best
        Doom-a-like so far. In saying that I don't mean that it's
        good because it comes close to Doom, because TFS is
        actually better. I know reading about games on the
        Internet can be daunting because everyone says the same
        thing: &quot;Breakthrough technology&quot;, &quot;3D
        Rendered graphics&quot;, &quot;The best&quot;, and so on
        until you just don't know who to believe. Well stop
        guessing because I'll tell you what I know based on my
        own experience.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">I bought
        Terminator Future Shock here in New Zealand a few months
        ago when I was having one of those game cravings that
        often strikes those like me. It costs a whopping $120.00
        but I forked it out because the demo I played had me
        hooked. (Keep in mind that I played the demo over and
        over again trying to make it last when finally I had to
        give in and get the real deal... the main reason was to
        see all the weapons some of which were removed from the
        demo). After taking it home I was impressed with the
        actual story that the demo left a mystery. But before
        getting to that I'll first take you around the TFS screen
        shots and perhaps (if I can get the graphics software to
        work right) a few close ups of the playing interface
        also.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Walking

        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">When you
        first begin TFS you see a wee opening animation. Then you
        come to a standardish-looking options screen where you
        can load, save, or change sound settings, etc. The
        background music is really cool with this one. But the
        views are even better. Here's a top-down view </font><a
        href="sniper.gif"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2"
        face="Arial">screen shot</font></a><font color="#FFFFFF"
        size="2" face="Arial"> of the streets in L.A., where your
        first few missions take place. That particular view is
        from a stair-set on the side of the building. That's
        outside. Now here's a </font><a href="termin4.gif"><font
        color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">screen shot</font></a><font
        color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial"> from inside one of
        SkyNET's outposts. The grenade launcher in your hand is
        truly the best weapon against the Terminator units
        themselves. Realistically though you shouldn't actually
        be that close to one of them. If you are then you won't
        last long - seriously, you won't! But there's more to
        TFS... you can drive cars too (in particular missions).</font></p>

        size="2" face="Arial"> is you in a jeep crashing through
        a robot. You can do this but obviously it'll cause damage
        if you do (but not a lot). The jeep is fast and has a
        mounted laser-cannon on it that you aim using your mouse.
        The jeep also has rockets (the right mouse button if I
        remember correctly). After driving around you might want
        to fly as well. Although flying is nice, you'll need a
        joystick for that unlike driving. That's not a problem
        though because you can change your controller-type
        anytime (along with saving).</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Flying</font></p>

        that the TFS game box mentions your being able to fly. It
        is pretty slow but it can easily avoid ground targets by
        flying over buildings or mountains. You actually play the
        mission who aim is to steal the thing so whenever you fly
        it you feel a bit personal about it. Having risked your
        life to capture it and all. The enemy flying targets,
        however, aren't so easy to handle, especially when they
        gang-up on you. That's why you need that joystick (the
        keyboard is good too).</font></p>

        spending hours downloading a demo you can order a
        testdrive of TFS for a really low price. The testdrive is
        the real game! And we can almost always get it to you
        overnight! Prices for the Testdrives can be found at an </font><a

        color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">. I hope you try
        TFS because you really should experience this kind of
        precision first-person gaming. By precision I mean the
        ability to actually aim at particular areas of moving
        targets or use chain reactions to do added enemy damage.
        In the meantime, have a happy time cruising the old
        Internet. Say hi to Elvis if you see him about!</font></p>

        looks like there wasn't enough time to go into the game
        interface... but you can see it in the lower portion of
        the screen shots if you look closely enough.</font></p>
