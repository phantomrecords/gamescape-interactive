        bombs up as they go. Couldn't the programmers have made
        it so you can only pick up bombs if you can see them?
        That way, you would have had to look down at least,
        rather than having your opponent nonchalantly wander in
        and pick them up without any effort? As for the rest of
        the arsenal, there's a shrinker, which can be used to
        shrink down the smaller baddies, so you can stomp them.
        There's a double rapid fire rocket launcher, a freezer,
        to freeze </td>
        <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="190" height="346">and
        shatter baddies, and finally, tripbombs. These are
        particularly good, because you can wander up to a wall,
        prime them, and then wander off. Wait for someone to step
        into the barely visible beam, and it's goodbye! Course,
        all these need ammo. Run out of that, and it's down to
        using your feet, matey, and a kung fu kick isn't much cop
        against an incoming Exocet. <p><b>Suits you, sir </b></p>
        <p><img src="../../images/spacer.gif" width="27"

        </td>
        <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="190" height="346">of
        particularly nasty baddies to use it all on. Enter the
        aliens. There's a number of baddies, from the standard
        pistol wielding troopers, , and the shotgun wielding pig
        cop, all the way through the face-hugger like Protozoids,
        the home-and-explode sentry drones, up to the nasty
        stomping end of level bosses. <p><img
        src="../../images/spacer.gif" width="27" height="15">Sounds
        good, and the monsters do come at you think and fast.
        However, and this is my only real gripe, they do feel a
        bit samey. Some lob missiles, some lob bullets, but <a
