        overhead view perspective with improved graphics. Cities,
        terrain, and mobile units are rendered in finer detail
        and colour than the original <i>Civ</i>. Though I must
        say that one of the most exciting additions to <i>Civ II</i>
        is the video clips that accompany the Wonders of the
        World advancements </p>

        to the player. When the player has successfully built a
        Wonder, such as the Colossus of Rhodes, or the Pyramids,
        the system kicks in with a mini-movie, each with its own
        unique and well-played theme music. These clips include
        actual film footage, historical drawings, writings, or
        still photos of ancient artifacts. Needless to say, the
        first time I saw the Great Wall of China on my 486 SX/66

        a Throne Room feature which will become </td>

        height="15"> This strategy game possesses a very
        simplistic story line; it's the journey you, the gamer,
        take from the very beginning of your culture's
        civilization to the point where you successfully colonize
        another planet. The rest of the story in between is up to
        you. You're not alone, however; Sid Meier was thoughtful <a
