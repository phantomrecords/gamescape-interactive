        set in the not too distant future. The bombs were
        launched, all out Nuclear War affected every part of the
        world's population. Now, 60 odd years later, two very
        distinct and different groups of people have been formed,
        each with their own conflicting beliefs and religion that
        forces what's left of human life <i>back</i> into war.
        The superb FMV computer-generated introduction tells the
        story well, complete with the melodramatic voice-over
        from the narrator. &quot;And so... there </td>

        managed to hide underground while the Earth's atmosphere
        was completely polluted with poisonous and radioactive
        gases. They stayed underground for 60 years, continually
        searching for resources to keep them alive, until just
        recently, where they are now starting to emerge to the
        surface.</p>

        src="../../images/spacer.gif" width="27" height="15">The
        other group, the 'Evolved', are the batch of humans that
        could not find sanctuary underground. Millions died, some
        survived, progressively mutating into gross-looking and
        very paranoid beings. They are majorly deprived of any
        sort of technology, and rely on training the also badly
        'evolved' wildlife for their weapons. So their equivalent
        of the Survivor's 4x4 Pickup would be to mount a
        galloping mini-dinosaur type creature, or command huge
        threatening poison-spitting scorpions.<a
