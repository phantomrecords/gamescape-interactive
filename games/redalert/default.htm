Player Review</font><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
</font>&quot;Thank you for Red Alert, it was delivered promptly
and has turned out to be well worth the money. I can't believe I
was going to pay more for it at &quot;D-- Sm--h
Electronics&quot;, and I would have had to go and pick it up
myself! I have just conquered the world as the General of the
Soviet side and thought I had better tell someone about it. The
graphics as I'm sure you know are much better than the infamous
C&amp;C, the scroll rates are higher and smoother and run very
nicely on my 133mhz, 16meg, 8x cdrom machine. The video footage
that precedes every mission is fantastic, my personal favorite is
of an allied tank being whammied from behind by a pair of
missiles launched from a mean MIG 29 (in racing red of course!)
that whistles through a valley at HIGH speed. The story line is
better than C&amp;C, and the opening sequence that gives the gist
of 'why' things are the way they are is superb. Additionally the
game-engine or whatever it's called is smart and is not easily
fooled by bluff counter-attacks or sending the 'pawns' in to die
while the nobility takes out the really vital stuff. The computer
opponent responds to weaknesses that may be created but ceases to
attack if attack is no longer profitable. The longest mission I
ever played was the second to last, when I just could not see an
opening and was constantly on the defence; however, after 7 hours
I finally whipped his tail. This game is the one for anybody who
is into chess, Civ' or Sim City games. You have full license to
print what you want from this reveiw, because I think eveyone
needs a copy. So having said that when can I testdrive 'Skynet'
or maybe a Flight sim - I have the Sidewinder Pro joystick that
needs regular exercise if you know what I mean! Talk to you
soon.&quot;</p>
