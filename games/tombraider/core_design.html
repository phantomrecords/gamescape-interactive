<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Based in the UK, Core Design is one of the hottest and
most talented development teams in the industry.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Founded in 1988 by Jeremy Smith, Core's success has depended
on the development of high-quality, award winning games . Early hits include
<B>Rick Dangerous</B> and <B>Corporation</B>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Most recently Core has built its reputation on award winning
console titles like <B>Thunderstrike 2</B> and <A HREF="http://www.eidosinteractive.com/shellshock/shellshock.html">Shellshock</A>.
Thunderstrike 2 was awarded Sega of America's Best Graphics of the Year
for 1995. <B>Shellshock</B>, a tank shooter, was just released this summer.
In the game, you are a member of a covert group of M-13 Predator tank commandos
fighting for justice in a world overtaken by crime. Check out the interactive
demo on Eidos Interactive's web site! (<A HREF="http://www.eidosinteractive.com/">www.eidosinteractive.com</A>)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Their latest effort, <B>Tomb Raider</B>, may be their
biggest hit yet. Developed for PlayStation, Saturn and PC simultaneously,
<B>Tomb Raider</B> incorporates both action and adventure elements for
superior and addictive gameplay. The incredible graphics and fully rendered
3D environments insure this game will provide a complete gaming experience
unlike anything seen before.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Core's Team of nine artists and programmers have been
working on <B>Tomb Raider</B> for the past year and a half. Their efforts
are evident even in the early stages of the game. <B>Tomb Raider</B> is
comprised of complex 3D levels requiring hours of exploration, puzzle solving
and lots of action as the main character, Lara Croft, searches for pieces
of the ancient Scion. Lara's moves are incredibly smooth and agile as she
flips, jumps, swims and shoots her way through Roman, Incan, Egyptian and
Atlantian worlds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Core has also produced <B><A HREF="http://www.eidosinteractive.com/machinehead/machinehead.html">BLAM!
Machine Head</A></B> for the PlayStation and Saturn. This action-packed
3D shooter also boasts incredible gameplay and graphics as well as captivating
main character, Dr. Kimberly Stride.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Everything Core touches seems to turns to gold. With their
strong list of current and future titles, Core is a company to watch. Keep
your eyes open for more future hits! </FONT></P>
