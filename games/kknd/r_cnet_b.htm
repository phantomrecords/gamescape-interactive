        intelligence) provides a worthy opponent. Later missions
        are challenging even when you've played them before.
        Individual unit AI can be more frustrating, however.
        Sometimes units get stuck, but thankfully, constant
        vigilance over them is not necessary--they arrive
        eventually. <p><img src="../../images/spacer.gif"

        interface amenities that would make this task easier. <p><img
        src="../../images/spacer.gif" width="27" height="15">For
        example, there is no way to deselect a unit from a group
        of units, and there is no way to shift-click individual
        units in order to group them (à la WarCraft). This means
        units must be moved before they are grouped, and that
        takes time, which is precisely what I never have in a
        real-time game. However, Krush does have the innovative
        group </p>

        feature introduced in the original Command &amp; Conquer.
        Once units are grouped, hold down the Ctrl key and press
        1 through 0 to save the group. The group can then be
        recalled by simply pressing 1 through 0. <p><img
        src="../../images/spacer.gif" width="27" height="15">Saying
        that Krush features resource management is kind of like
        saying that Quake features projectile management.
        Remembering that oil is the game's only resource, you can
        see why resource management isn't much of a challenge.
