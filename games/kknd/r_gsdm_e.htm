        <b><i>KKnD</i></b> does include a cool new feature that
        marks an improvement over current real-time strategies.
        In this game, you have the ability to build multiple
        units by giving a simple order, so you no longer have to
        spend time clicking once every 2 seconds trying to build
        up a small army of minigunners. You can either set the
        computer to build, say, five ATV's and stop, or actually
        keep building indefinitely until you order it to halt.</p>

        to incorporate one of the best AI's in real-time
        strategies yet. I have my doubts. It's true that the
        missions are incredibly hard, but this may not be down to
        a clever AI. After all, the computer often starts the
        game with a base and a heavily outnumbering amount of
        troops, so he always gets the advantage - the fact that
        he will continually send in small attacks, sometimes
        charge in on different sides (but rarely at the same
        time) doesn't really demonstrate </p>

        we haven't seen before. Units do occasionally retreat
        when reduced from a large group to just one or two, but
        this is hardly ground-breaking. What makes the missions
        so annoying is that you can rarely win one until you've
        played it over 10 times, studied the map completely, and
        then worked out an unbeatable strategy; and even then,
        that might not be good enough! The level designer himself
        even states on the KKnD website, that he finds one of the
        levels near impossible, regardless of the fact that he<a
