        are too many nice graphic touches in the game for me to
        mention them all, but they include: when you use a spell

        were crouching in it; when you get better armor and your
        on-screen character actually appears different because of
        it. (this allows you to tell which characters in a
        multiplayer game might be the most helpful_1or the most
        dangerous.) The list goes on and on. Suffice it to say
        that the development team and the artists involved not
        only knew what they were doing technically, but had some
        inspiration and imagination to go along with it. </td>

        music in Diablo is enchanting, and complements the
        graphics and gameplay perfectly. Real acoustic guitars
        are featured, along with other stringed instruments and
        flutes, combining to provide a mostly soft, mysterious,
        and fairly authentic medieval feel. In times of combat,
        the pace often quickens and drums or horn sounds may be
        introduced.</p>
