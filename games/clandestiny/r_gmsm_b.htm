        on the cursed clan of the MacPhiles and you are the last
        living descendent that must destroy the hex and claim
        your legacy. Your character, Andrew MacPhiles, must
        travel from his homeland of America to the distant shores
        of Scotland. Unfortunately this plot has been over used
        throughout the years, but the comic take </font></p>

        play. In sticking with tradition, Andrew MacPhiles is as
        cowardly as his descendants (this doesn't exactly make
        him exciting to play). He went to Scotland not to destroy
        the curse, but to clam his imaginary fortune. Andrew is
        accompanied by his girlfriend who is enthralled by the
        castle and the idea of marrying a Scottish Earl. To say
        the least, Paula is annoying and full of grand wedding
        plans, but she does add some much-needed comic relief.

        All of the characters do usually give humorous
        performances, although I'm sure they are sometimes
