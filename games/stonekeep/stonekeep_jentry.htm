        Stonekeep: Saturday, March 8, 1997</strong></font><p><font
        color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Stonekeep</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Having
        just finished playing an old StoneKeep demo I thought I
        should make a journal entry about the game in case anyone
        else was wondering. I watched this game on the shelves of
        game stores in the U.S. and considered buying it many
        times. I never actually did and a fortuitous decision
        that was because the gameplay is &quot;a little less than
        impressive.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The game
        is by Interplay who made Out Of This World (a very good
        game, even today because it's challenging and creative
        but playable - and fits on just two floppies). But it
        seems that StoneKeep wasn't bestowed with such
        pleasantries. Gameplay is similar to Eye Of The Beholder
        by TSR, but has movie cut-scenes, etc. instead of the
        comic-book scenes found in Eye Of The Beholder. Also the
        interface is confusing, although Interplay felt it was
        liberating. The creatures are also blocky (even for
        animation standards from 1995) and don't offer much in
        the way of creepiness. I found the dialogue more
        reminiscent of a B-grade movie than anything else I can
        recall at the moment. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">So
        needless to say I wouldn't recommend ye ol' Keep even
        though it is old so sells for a low price. The fact is
        there are many other great games of this type selling for
        even less or free from the folks who want to trade a few
        for something current. And to name a few: Eye Of The
        Beholder, SpellCaster, or Dungeon Hack, come to mind. All
        older and all cheap these days. </font></p>

        that's all for me on StoneKeep.</font></p>
