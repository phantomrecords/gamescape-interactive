<p>Cyberia 2 Stars: **** </p>

<p>I didn't like the first one of this series and never actaully
ended up playing it through. I had other games to play, namely
Comanche 1.0 and X-Wing, and couldn't be bothered wading through
the mindless arcade shoot-up stages. This Cyberia though is much
better. It still follows a similar game model but it just does a
better job of carrying out its mission. A good example of this is
the car chase on the bridge. You get a well-integrated transition
anim that sets you up as the driver and then your off. You see
the little targets lit up and those are the ones you must hit.
But what's refreshing about these in Cyberia 2 is that you get
more time to hit the targets. It's not the useless
&quot;quickie&quot; fly-bys like in Cyberia 1 and Rebel Assault
1. No, these sequences have a chase and shoot feel to them. You
vantage point remains somewhat stable and aligned as you try to
blow them away. And this is realistic because if you were driving
you'd do the same thing. There are also nice little touches to
the entire segment. First of all each one is very short so even
though you can't save (but I wish I could) it really, honestly,
isn't bad when you die and start at the beginning again. You'll
only have a short way to go before you back where you left off.
Another nice touch is that the makers of the game will show a
little animation of new targets as they enter your view. One
showed new cycle bandits entering the view as they readied road
mines for dropping in my path. That's the game's way of saying
&quot;destroy the cycle bandit and the mines will stopp
falling.&quot; And the transition is smooth between the anims.
It's not choppy at all. I think it's safe to say that this one
has fair appeal.

<p>Tombraider Review Stars: *** </p>

<p>I'm only giving three stars to Tombraider because the demo I
played was quite short. It's only 2.2 mbs but that means it
downloads fast. It is however enough to give you a taste of
what's in store in the full game. Most importantly it shows off
the Tombraider concept which in my belief is original. No other
adventure recipe is quite like this one which mixes real-time
walking, swimming and combat, in a brew of problem-solving. You
see in Tombraider, you play a women (another original) whose out
for treasure and money. But to get that she'll need to be smart
plus greedy. And you'll have to use her abilities to avoid
attacking bears, zombies, and dogs, among other baddies. In
Tombraider teamwork is the word of the today. You devise the
tactics and Lara carries them out. Together you'll both end up
rich. </p>

<p>Your obstacles, the breathing ones, are your biggest threat
but you can avoid death if you use a little common sense. This is
because most of them are localised to one specific area of the
game. They have &quot;lairs.&quot; Although these essentially
amount to a corner over here or a corner over there you can still
avoid them. This could be a negative component if the game
weren't so cerebral. But since it is... it's good to know that
creatures won't typically attack until you cross their terf. This
lets you concentrate on solving puzzles, opening secret doors,
and finding clues. I must admit that writing this review is
somewhat ackward because video games are near on impossible to
put into words. Writing too much makes some people go
&quot;WOW&quot; while others go &quot;that's dumb.&quot; It all
depends on the writer-reader chemistry so be aware of that as you
read and don't hesitate to download the demo. I'll tell you about
it now. </p>

<p>When it starts, (remember I played the same one you can
download), the screen was blocky. I pressed F1 to increase the
resolution. The animation was smooth too, with well designed
transitions between one view to the next. There was a wierd bit
about the visuals though that I'll mention. Is was the difficulty
getting a view that is direclty behind Lara. At times you look on
at an angle so you can see her but not what she can see. Odd and
a a bit disturbing. Oh well, you'll see when you play it. </p>

<p>Now about sound. The effects are are mood-creating and by that
I mean they are accurate. Well maybe accurate isn't the word for
it... I'll give an example. As Lara walks around you can hear the
damp ground beneath her crunch with each step. As you interact
with levers and traps you hear detailed sound effects of the
motions. And the sounds aren't repeditive. They seem to be on a
random-rotation so if you keep pushing a stone for example, it
moves at different distances each time and sounds change
accordingly. A complaint though is that some sounds are a hard to
hear. At times I turned up the volume to compensate just to hear
another sound that seems too loud. And the music didn't work on
my soundcard (but it's a crap one anyway - it had trouble with
Diablo and Rebel Assault too). All in all the effects worked for
me. I'll be changing my soundcard soon so I can hear the music.
Until then I'd have to guess that the music would be as well
sorted as the sound effects. </p>

<p>Sounds aside let's talk about how interesting the game is to
play. What can you do? You can run around, shoot at things every
once in a while, swim, pull levers, dodge arrows, roll, side
step, and automatically aim at two different enemies at once. You
can pick up shot guns, keys, supplies (which are pretty plentiful
thankfully) and secret Incan artifacts. But at the end of the day
your brain is happy because of the challenges and treasure
hunting. We all have drab lives; we need mental puzzles to keep
the old nuerons awake! Oh and to further avoid boredom, you only
have to fight each monster once (unless you loose) because you
can save the game when the &quot;terf is secure.&quot; There are
eight or so save slots so you can share among flatmates - that's
handy. In fact there are quite a bit of nice touches in
Tombraider that you'll want to have a go at. There's no
substitute for first-hand experience. </p>

<p>Maybe, just maybe (and I say this with reserve), this game
will have staying power. But on the other hand most of them look
great after the first 5 hours. How do you feel after 100? That's
the real question! </p>

<p>Syndicate Wars *** </p>

<p>Bullfrog has finally unhatched Syndicate 2. It's definately
better than the last one but I think it could be improved. Not
that I'm a programmer or anything because I'm not. But I am the
one who plays it and I'm the one they're trying to impress so
doesn't my grobble have weight? </p>

<p>Right then I'll start by saying the sprites move too quickly.
They actually walk faster than car's drive when their going their
fastest. That's not realistic. And the map is so small that once
you attack a baddie, he and his cronies are all over you from
everywhere before you know it. Dammit, I want the chance to use
strategy. I don't want to run around blasting the bastards from
across the street in a test of brawn. I want find a hidden little
nook and set a bomb whose chain reaction takes out 80% and wounds
the rest. Why can't they walk slower after they take over 50%
damage. Wouldn't you have a limp after a bomb blew up 5 feet
away? And speaking of damage I'd sure like to see how much is
being done. There's no enemy heath gauge! I don't know... it
didn't draw me in. I played for a while but soon after I was
running out of money so my weapons research fell behing so my
guys started getting out gunned. Another thing! There's a clone
weapon that makes you look like a civilian. But if you shoot at
an enemy they zero and attack you ignoring your clone status.
That's okay as long as you're in view but if I run around a
corner and put my guns away they should loose me in the crowd...
but no... they don't. What this game needs is more money, more
hints, a more realism. A game editor would be absolutely perfect
cuz then I could cheat by slowing down the enemy and giving
myself more money (since you can't tax your regions in this one
as far as I know). The point is that to get into Syndicate Wars
you need to have time on your hands. You need to surf the net and
find all the cheats and hints floating around on people's web
sites. Like this page ----- which tells you how to rob banks and
get money in leiu of taxes. The upside to all this is that
Syndicate 2 consumes uddles of time so you don't have to buy
another game for months. Even if you're a gamer on nitro you can
still get past at least two months without looking for another
game. Unless of course something amasing comes out like another
Command and Conquer and you have money to burn. All in all
Syndicate Wars is more than just the game. It's an entire
activity of learning. Learning to play, learning to cheat, and
learning to get control over the utter chaos that runs rampant in
modern day Bulgaria, Rome, and Romania among others. With the
help of the Internet, friends across the modem playing against
you, and (if things really get bad) the manual... you can make
playing Syndicate Wars a seriously dynamic pastime. Writing this
review has renewed my faith in the game because I've realised to
enjoy it fully means doing a bit of research and getting other
people involved. You need to find friends to play with, Internet
sites to get hints from, and use the old brian to get money so
you can buy those cool weapons that make life meaningful. But as
always don't take my word for it... download the demo and judge
for yourself. That's what it's here for. And when you done, come
back and email us your opinion - do you agree, do you disagree?
What on your mind bud? </p>

<p>Quake *** </p>

<p>If Doom gets three stars so does Quake. And if I have to say
one more thing about Quake I'll scream! It's just Doom! No matter
what you say, how you cut it, Quake is Doom reincarnated like
Jason or Freddy. And now there's millions of Quake-Doom alikes!
There's Final Doom, Ultimate Doom, Doom 95, Doom II, and Doom
Unleashed, Doom the 13th, Quake Goes To Hell (okay maybe those
last two are made up). Sounds to me like somebody sold the Doom
rights to the world's hungriest marketing company! Enough is
enough! I mean the play is not anything special if you ask me.
Personally I like Doom I better than Doom II and Quake. The
coolest thing about playing Doom is not the creatures, it's the
background music. The music is cool. Everyone knows that. Even
when anti-gamers see someone playing it they crowd up say
&quot;hey that music is cool.&quot; So what's Quake got? Music?
It didn't strike my &quot;cool cord.&quot; Maybe you'll disagree
or perhaps you didn't play the first Doom. Either way you can get
the demo here if you like (it's huge though and by the time you
finish downloading hell might freeze over). When you get it
you'll basically see a darker version of Doom. Why not just get
Doom and then search the net for the infinite alternative worlds
you play for that one. I've played the Barney one, Simpsons one,
and I hear there's Beavis and Buthead and Star Wars world. In the
Star Wars one you get a lightsaber! There's like a new Doom world
made every 10 seconds or someting! And before I go... if you
don't have anyone else to play with, don't waste money buying
Quake when you can download Doom, Doom II, Hexen, and Descent for
free and play over online services like Kali for about $40 bucks
a year or for free on the net-based Doom servers all throughout
the world. These games will sooth your Quakings until the price
drops to about $45 dollars. Then you can buy for collectors
value. </p>

<p>Here's a jump start to sooth your Quakings: </p>

<p>gimme Doom gimme Doom II gimme Hexen gimme Descent </p>

<p>To find the alternative Doom worlds search www.yahoo.com for
&quot;Doom WADS.&quot; Bye now! </p>

Diablo **** </p>

<p>What can I say about Diablo. If it weren't for the cheats I
think I'd never get past the first level! This game is hard@!@@!
I'm embarrassed but I won't trash it because of that...! It's
just that I used to be good at them all!!! This game gets
respect! The demo is a huge file and although there isn't much
plot to it (because it's a demo) it still has challenge. It's
available on most game review CDs. You'll find it in PC Gamer, PC
Games Magazine, and some printings of PC Format. But after you
get it come back here and follow our cool links to make your demo
more enjoyable. You'll need the cheat codes and hints from the
web to get free health potions, duplicate weapons, character
skill increases, and the very cool, extremely valuable, demo
hack: an amasing file that grants you, the player, the rights to
level 2,3, and 4 in the dungeon. Without it you only get level 1.
And believe me, it's quite a short level! As far my view on this
game goes... all I can say is... the real game will be more
interesting because it will have a plot, and the gameplay will be
awesome once the free multiplayer service Battle.net goes online.
I really mean that bit about battle net. Diablo was made with it
in mind and has even undergone changes since the demo came out to
make multiplaying more fun. Most importantly the changes (over
1000) came from email suggestions by early players. Amasing that
the makers even listened! Such care is remarkable is bound to
show as you play. Stay up to date on multiplayer Diablo by
checking here at the Battle.net home page- maybe it's online
right now! If not you can start solving the Diablo secret by
yourself until it comes online. </p>
