        the icon on the lower right should be parallel) you will
        only lose half of your gold if you are killed by another
        player. However, if you are killed by monsters, you drop
        all of your items. As a result, PKillers will typically
        backstab you while you are in a fight with the denizens
        of the deep, letting the monsters finish you off.
        Typically, if a new character enters the game and refuses

        to worry. If </td>
