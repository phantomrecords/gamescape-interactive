        evolutionary behaviour, you will never get one that
        produces the script to Hamlet, no matter how many
        typewriters you throw its way. Eventually, the process of
        rearing a Norn and guiding it through its life becomes so
        routine as to end up a little tedious. It is also
        slightly distressing when they prove to be amazingly

        hours you will find yourself tiring of it a little,
        eventually giving it up for something a little more
        addictive and rewarding</p>
