        that becomes obvious is that this is a total rip-off of
        Origin's Crusader: No Remorse. Same isometric view, huge
        explosions, even similar colors and artwork. The one
        twist is that in Bedlam, you get to pilot three separate
        heavily armored RATs (Remote Assault Tanks) in an attempt
        to wipe out the infestation. Speaking of the RAT you're
        directing, it's an interesting piece of machinery.

        off the smallest ledge. It can deal death with several
        kinds of weapons (outfitted in the handy,
        MechWarrior-esque weapon installation screen), but it
        can't hop off a two-foot tall overhang. Go figure.<p><strong>-Gamezilla</strong></p>
