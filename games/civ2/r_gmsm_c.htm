        advisors all give credible performances that are somewhat
        stereotyped in their appearance and presentation, but are
        humorous for all that. The Attitude advisor is a
        glorified Elvis in a toga and the Trade advisor with his

        those of you out there who can't wait for a hint book,
        here are a few suggestions that you might find useful.
        First, when starting the game, no matter what nationality
        you choose, CUSTOMIZE IT. You needn't change anything;
        just click OK to accept the default setting. The reason
        for this is that the game will usually provide you with
        up to three more technological advances than you would
        not otherwise have (the basics being the ability to build
        roads, mines, and irrigation). In the long haul </td>

        need every edge you can get over your rivals especially
        later in the game.<p><img src="../../images/spacer.gif"
        width="27" height="15"> Remember to try and expand
        quickly in the beginning of the game. More cities means
        more revenue and higher production levels from your
        citizens. When possible, switch back and forth between
        Fundamentalism and Democracy for the ability to
        alternately control your workers and wage indiscriminate
        war when warranted, or provide an <a href="r_gmsm_d.htm"><img
