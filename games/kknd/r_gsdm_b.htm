        one another for the same reason most of today's cultures
        are constantly at war. They have different backgrounds,
        and believe in different God's. You get to play on either
        side, through a campaign of 15 missions. Each level is
        linked into with a preceeding FMV cutscene, where your
        commander briefs you on the upcoming mission. <p><img

        if you're into a sincerely atmospheric war-like
        simulation, then you should definitely look elsewhere.
        The whole game is a spoof; one Survivor mission has you
        rescuing a dorky bottom-ranked private who got lost,
        while the text at the side of the screen (typed by an
        unknown source) reads, &quot;let's just leave the idiot
        out there... what a nerd.&quot; I actually let out a
