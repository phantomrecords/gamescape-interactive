        Each mission features a number of different elements that
        you need to understand to get through, tempering the
        action with a fair amount of problem solving. Most of
        this is based around switches, power fields, gates, and
        moving platforms which enable you to get from one level
        or area to another. In addition, money, power-ups, armor,
        weapon loads, and other prizes are scattered throughout
        the terrain.<p><img src="../../images/spacer.gif"

        always a nice feature. And levels tend to move fast and
        furious, with lots of action and lots of carnage. Control
        of all this takes some getting used to, since movement
        and firing are completely based around the mouse: left
        button to move, right to fire. It&#146;s a tricky
        interface, but one that can be learned. It&#146;s much
        harder to get the hang of switching from one RAT to
        another in a single mission, which was at times more than
        I could juggle.<p><img src="../../images/spacer.gif"

        seems good, not great, that&#146;s because we&#146;ve
        seen this type of game done before and done better. Its
        frenetic pace and somewhat repetitive visuals can become
        tiring after a few missions, and play can wear thin. But
        if you like Crusader and want something with action
        that&#146;s a little faster, take the demo for a spin: it
        might just be what the doctor ordered.<p>-Gamespot</p>
