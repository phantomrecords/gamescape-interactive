        squad of Remote Assault Tanks (RATs), your job is to
        destroy the biomex where ever they are, and strike at the
        heart of their operations by wrecking key installations.
        Three RATs are at your disposal, each controlled from an
        &quot;satellite uplink&quot;: the standard metaphor for
        skewed, top-down perspective real-time action game.<p><img

        RATs themselves are kinda cool. They move and turn fast,
        and carry a nice assortment of weapons on </p>

        <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="190" height="346">their
        pylons. You start the game with a certain amount of
        money, and must buy weapons to arm each RAT. Bombs,
        bouncy grenades, sticky grenades, photon guns,
        conventional guns, delayed fuse bombs, and more provide a
        pretty good assortment of offensive weapons, with more
        available as you get deeper into the game. Defensive
        equipment like shields and sensors can also be fitted,
        though only two are allowed per RAT.<br>

        and begins with your RAT or RATs being dropped into the
        combat zone. The graphics here are, for the most part,
        pretty sharp, high-res visuals, with multi-level
        buildings, well-animated monsters, and plenty of fiery
        explosions. I found, however, that perspective was often
        a problem: I ran into a great deal of trouble telling one
        level from another in many instances. A little fiddling
        with the controls clarifies this problem, but more
        careful rendering would have been a <font size="3"> </font><a
