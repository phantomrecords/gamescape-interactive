        never get past the first level with a novice character!
        That's because Diablo isn't an easy game to conquer. It's
        tricky because the enemies arn't as dumb as door stops.
        Proof of this is the vast amounts of cheats available for
        Diablo. If it were easy no-one would want to cheat. But
        that's not to say Diablo is only fun if I cheat. <p><img
        src="../../images/spacer.gif" width="27" height="15">Diablo
        is fun because the enemies are cool and you can play on
        the Internet for free. </p>

        <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="190" height="346">Aside
        from that there is uddles of plot. <p><img
        src="../../images/spacer.gif" width="27" height="15">One
        of the early plot elements is the story of the Butcher!
        He's a nasty,fat, red orc (called an Overlord) who
        carries a hugh axe! One guess what he does with his tool
        in a Dungeon with no trees? He needs to be liberated from
        the Dungeon one way or another. But it won't be easy.
        He's fast and hard to kill without magic or speed on your
        side. Good luck, adventurer.</p>

        once you learn to bash the creatures to pulp it's still a
        challenge to figure how to do it without taking much
        damage. You know, to get the tidy victory over the sloppy
        one!<p><font size="3">The bottom line is that <em><strong>Diablo
        is the best game I've ever played! </strong></em>I'm
        still trying to figure out how Blizzard Entertainment
        managed to pull it off - an amasing accomplishment!</font></p>
