        would think that if I enjoyed The 11th Hour then
        Clandestiny (whose interface this game closely resembles)
        would be just as enjoyable, but it's not. Why? First, the
        characters are not nearly as appealing. In Clandestiny,
        the characters are childish and more often than not,
        annoying and long-winded. Secondly, the storyline is not
        nearly as appealing nor adventurous. As a player, you
        should feel driven to finish the game. Clandestiny, makes
        time stand still, and not in a good way. Lastly, the

        animation and the Scottish accents, but pay little
        attention to the storyline and the intelligence of the
        gamer. In comparing this game to other recent
        adventure-style games, for example Titanic, Clandestiny
        bored me rather than enthralled me.</font><p><font

        The majority of characters are true Scotsmen and women
        with their thick Scottish accents and quirky humor.
        However, if you are someone with Scottish heritage, you
        may find that the stereotypes get a little redundant and
        silly after an hour or so. Another disappointing aspect
        of Clandestiny is that the video does not run smoothly.
        The graphics are choppy, your character's movements are
