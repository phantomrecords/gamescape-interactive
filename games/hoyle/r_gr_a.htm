        and Hoyle Solitaire (sold separately) completely changed
        my belief that computer card games belong in the
        &quot;Games for People who have Lost the Will to
        Live&quot; bin. Smooth graphics, easy to learn interface,
        and a couple of nifty extras make these games quite
        addictive and a great way to kill a few more of those
        pesky brain cells.<p><img src="../../images/spacer.gif"

        of the classic casino game. For those of you who have
        never played the game, </p>
        </td>
        <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="190" height="346">here's
        a brief explanation. Cards are dealt to each player and
        the dealer, and whoever comes closest to 21 without going
        over wins (all players compete against the dealer).
        Players start with a bankroll of $5000, with the ultimate
        goal of hoarding a cool million. There are three modes of
        play available: Tutorial, Tournament, and Casino.
        Tutorial mode comes complete with drop down menus that
        suggest strategies for certain situations, while
        Tournament mode is where the big money is made. </td>
        <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="190" height="346">Casino
        mode is the default play level.<p><img
        src="../../images/spacer.gif" width="27" height="15">The
        graphics are pretty cool, although a little more variety
        would have been nice. More CPU controlled characters
        would have helped, as well as some sort of a dealer
        graphic. The game table looks strikingly real (although
        the cigarette ashes are missing). </p>

        height="15">By far the strongest facet of Blackjack lies
        in its attempt to create a realistic environment for the
        gamer. <a href="r_gr_b.htm"><img
