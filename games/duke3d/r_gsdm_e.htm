        slightly odder monsters, like <b><i>Doom 2's</i></b>
        baddie resurrecting Arch-Vile, or <b><i>Hexen's</i></b>
        Dark Bishop, with it's corner-turning fireballs. That
        said, there's something particularly spooky about
        stepping into a room only to hear 'Die, Human', and know
        there's a rocket with your name on it coming straight at
        you. <p><b>Jazz Club </b></p>

        <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="190" height="346">very
        well. The graphics are clear, even in standard VGA mode,
        and can be switched up to 800x600 mode, for extra
        clarity, albeit with some drop in frame-rate. You might
        just get away with standard VGA on a low-end 486 machine,
        but don't count on it. 486DX2-66 is the minimum you
        should really try this game on. The music thrums away in
        the background, without being too obtrusive, and is
        really something if you've got an AWE32. Yells and booms
        abound, with Duke piping up with quips every now and
        then.</td>

        src="../../images/spacer.gif" width="27" height="15">There's
        also an added touch of humour in this game. You'll find
        loads of movie references popping up, from the cocooned
        girl in the sewers, to the crushed Terminator in the
        steel mill. There's also loads of extra secrets, if you
        look hard enough. The game CD also comes with a number of
        extras, including the full registered versions of Duke
        Nukem 1 + 2 (okayish platform games), a game editor (good
        once you get into it, but not intuitive), and a whole
        bunch of other utilities. <a href="r_gsdm_f.htm"><img
