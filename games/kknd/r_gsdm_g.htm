        longevity. The interesting weapons and creatures, along
        with the cool setting, and well-designed multiplayer maps
        sum up to make very worthy competition for the other
        multiplay strategy titles. Unfortunately, and probably
        the reason for the game's failing to cause a great stir
        in the online gaming community, playing over the Net is
        pretty much impossible on a standard 33.6 modem. If <b><i>Red
        Alert</i></b> can do it so smoothly, then <b><i>KKnD</i></b>
        certainly could have; they just didn't bother optimising
        it.</td>

        height="15">There seems to be many bad points in this
        review, that severely outweigh the good. This is unfair
        really, as <b><i>KKnD</i></b> <i>is</i> a quality game.
        It stands out from the crowd with great graphics, well
        presented storyline, a cute humor that shows they never
        took the plot very seriously (not a bad thing!), and a
        terrific range of units and structures that vary on both
        sides. It also plays well in multiplayer, with both the
        Survivors and Evolved being pretty even in battle.</p>

        a combination of small faults. Along with the difficult
        missions, and the slightly inefficient and dated AI and
        interface, <b><i>KKnD</i></b> advances nothing in the 6
        months that have passed since <b><i>RA</i></b> was
        released. If you're tired of waiting for the big releases
        like <b><i>Rebellion</i></b> and <b><i>Starcraft</i></b>
        that promise to be nothing less than spectacular, then <b><i>KKnD</i></b>
        provides a very nice filler.<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
