</font>&quot;After playing Krush, Kill 'N' Destroy's beginning
levels, I began to think this game was a lot like Virgin
Interactive's Z. It's so much like Z, in fact, that they could
call it &quot;Y,&quot; as in &quot;Y bother.&quot; As I
progressed, however, I learned why. Once past the first few
levels, resource management enters the game and adds a level of
depth beyond Z and more in line with WarCraft II. Combine the
graphics and style of Z with the resource management of WarCraft,
and you get a pretty fair picture of Electronic Arts' Krush, Kill
'N' Destroy. With two great references like these, it is hard to
go wrong.&quot;<br>

Review</font><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
&quot;</font>As most gamers are no doubt aware, unless incredibly
new to the PC strategy scene, real-time war games are all the
rage. You can barely step through a PC games store without one
falling from the shelves and bonking you on the head. The heavily
favored opinion currently is that <b><i>Red Alert</i></b>
maintains the crown of real-time champion - which happens to be
the sequel to <b><i>Command &amp; Conquer</i></b>, the former
title-holder from the same game developer, <i>Westwood Studios</i>.
So is it finally time for a new company to come along and swipe
the honor? And if so, could it possibly be as big an outsider as
the not well known Australian game developing group, <i>Beam
Software</i>?&quot;<font color="#000080" size="3" face="Arial"><strong><br>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial">Gamezilla<br>
Review</font><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
</font>&quot;The old saying goes that imitation is the sincerest
form of flattery. If this is true, then Westwood Studios and
Blizzard Entertainment should be flattered, but more for the
thought than for the result. <i>Red Alert</i> to date has sold
close to 2 million units. Same for <i>Warcraft 2</i>. Major moola
in the gaming world, and there are now, naturally, lots of
competitors looking to snag a share of the real time strategy
gaming audience that Westwood &amp; Blizzard almost single
handedly created. But remember the history of imitation that we
gleaned from the <i>Doom</i> phenomenon: the original was
awesome, but it took 2 years for a real challenger to come along.
Thus far, C&amp;C is a year and a half out of the gate, and I can
tell you definitively that thus far there are no true claimants
to its throne. This little dissertation is a long-winded way of
saying what you've no doubt already guessed I was going to say: I
know Red Alert, I've played Red Alert for hours upon end, and
KKND is no Red Alert.</p>

<p>&quot;But that's the <i>point</i> stupid!&quot; I can hear
some of you thinking already. OK, granted, it wouldn't be fun to
play another game that was <i>just like</i> Red Alert or <i>just
like</i> Warcraft 2. But KKND is so far removed from its
competitors in both its sophistication of gameplay and its
technical construction that I really wish it was a lot more like
the games it is seeking to emulate. </p>

<p>The upshot is this: there's been a nuclear war...the survivors
went underground and bided their time while the not-so-fortunate
stayed up in the nuclear winter, mutated, and waited for the
survivors to poke their heads above ground so they could rip them
off. Now it's all-out war with the mutated (&quot;evolved&quot;
to their way of thinking) sporting such troops as two-story-high
beetles, plasma-hurling scorpions, and, my favorite, giant crabs
with surgically implanted machine guns. The survivors have more
mundane troops; basically anything that you saw in <i>Mad Max</i>
is in the survivors' arsenal. They even all have an Australian
accent to boot: &quot;G'day mate, I'm gonna have to toss your
giant crab on the barbie.&quot; </p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Gameplay/Controls:</strong></font></p>

<p>If you've played other real time wargames, KKND will be a snap
to pick up. If you haven't played other real time strategy games,
suffice it to say that with beginning to intermediate mouse
skills and a little studying of the manual and you'll have no
troubles. </p>

<p>Gameplay is very straightforward: wipe out your opponents. You
get resources by sending oil rigs out into the field to search
for oil caches. Once you've set up a rig, your oil trucks meander
to and fro from your base to collect the goods. Oil is cash, cash
is life_1;while the oil flows, you'll do alright. A word of
warning though: the oil trucks are <i>very</i> stupid. You must
babysit them at all times to have any chance of keeping your cash
flowing. On the flip side though, unlike in the other real time
wargames out there, KKND allows you to queue the production of
units, so you just tell your barracks to build 10 shotgunners,
and, money permitting, the AI does the rest. This is a huge plus,
as it allows for less micromanagement of your forces, which
equates to more time for you to be out hunting down the enemy (or
looking after your oil trucks). Also, it means that while you're
out fighting, if some of the bad dudes backdoor your base, you're
much more likely to have a fresh squad standing around waiting
for somebody to shoot at.</p>

<p>As in C&amp;C and Warcraft, you will also encounter the
&quot;straggler&quot; problem in single player missions, wherein
your goal is to utterly obliterate your enemy. You'll go out,
perform famously, but then be left with a seemingly empty map and
no end to the mission. The problem, of course, being that <i>somewhere</i>
out in wastelands, there is one last enemy who just happens to be
napping under a tree. Where he stays until you stumble across him
and kill him 20 minutes after every other battle has been won.
The only game to have solved this problem thus far is <i>Lords of
the Realm II</i> with its &quot;mop up&quot; feature that allows
for a quick resolution once the main fight has been decided. I
wish more real time games allowed for such an option. </p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Difficulty:</b></font></p>

<p>Have you ever played a game against somebody who's lots better
than you are and therefore goes easy on you and lets you win a
few before mopping up the floor with you when they really put
their heart into it? If so, then you'll know how it feels to play
KKND_1;the first several missions are <i>cakewalks</i>, as the
computer sends wave after hapless wave of cannon fodder into the
teeth of your defenses and lets you happily mow them down and
feel unnecessarily proud of yourself. But then it wises up. In
mission five, the computer suddenly descends on you with a half
dozen unit types you've never encountered before and basically
wipes you off the map. And it only gets tougher from there. I'm
not sure what the AI programmers were thinking, because there is
really no learning curve here, just missions a six year old could
win or missions that will have you swearing at the computer for
being unfair_1;nothing in between. </p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Multiplayer:</b></font></p>

<p>Problems here. Big time. Once (and if) you <i>do</i> get
connected with someone, don't expect your troops who are
sauntering across the map to remain in the same space-time
continuum as the rest of the game_1;it is not uncommon for a
whole phalanx of footsoldiers to go AWOL, only to pop up a second
later half way across the map from where they just were.
Sometimes this gives you a great and unexpected advantage, but
more often it just pisses you off and confuses your strategy.
And, as I alluded to earlier, it is a royal pain in the neck just
to get a simple modem game going. It took us seven attempts to
even get to the first game screen, and then several more attempts
to get beyond that screen going black and hanging <i>both</i>
systems. This is, by the way, with name brand 28.8 modems. </p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Graphics:</b></font></p>

<p>This is one area where KKND does quite well_1;a lot of work
was expended to come up with creative scenery and strategically
challenging maps. This alone might be enough to sell some real
time gamers on KKND, as the maps take on three dimensions on
several occasions, allowing troops to cross bridges high
overhead, or land atop mesas for a later drop in your enemy's
base. Unit graphics are not bad either, although I found them
less sophisticated than either Warcraft 2 or the C&amp;C line. </p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Audio:</b></font><font size="2"> </font></p>

<p>The audio in KKND is adequate buring battles, and the
soundtrack is a kind of pop/synth with a funky beat that keeps
the mood light even when your guys are getting pummeled. What I
really liked though were the voice overs in the between mission
cutscenes. Like the nervous private who looks like he just
stepped from behind a McDonald's counter to suit up for service:
&quot;Um, commander...hi. This is a great base you just built,
and we really like it and everything, but see, um, well, the
thing is, we're about to be overrun&quot;. Much better than some
Raul Julia look-alike in a second-hand Saddam Hussein shirt any
day. </p>

<p><font size="3"><b>System Requirements:</b></font></p>

<p>MS-DOS 5.0 or greater (Windows 95 compatible), Pentium 90 or
faster, 28 MB disk space, 16 MB RAM, 1 MB VESA-compatible video
card, 4X CD-ROM, Keyboard, 100% Microsoft-compatible mouse.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Installation &amp; Documentation:</b></font></p>

<p>OK, I've got to say that I loved the manual for this game. No,
I'm not being facetious, it is funny, witty, and one of the
better elements to this game. The descriptions of the various
creatures and weapons are all well done and make what would
otherwise be yet another boring booklet quite entertaining.</p>

<p>Installation, on the other hand, while easy to accomplish,
didn't quite accomplish what it should. In Windows 95, everything
worked pretty well (with a minor sound card tweak), but in DOS
(supposedly the native OS for this game), little worked_1;no
videos, no sounds, and a game executable that only fired up and
got into the game about 1 in every 3 attempts. After a reinstall
it seemed to work better for a day or two, then began
encountering sound and video problems again, especially at the
end of missions, resulting in the loss of the mission since the
crash precluded saving the scenario as won. A major bummer after
a difficult campaign. I'd recommened keeping it inside a box
under Win 95_1;it ran fine like that, faster even, I'd say. </p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Bottom Line:</b></font><font size="2"> </font></p>

<p>KKND is an OK strategy game. It's fun to see the new terrains
and unit types, and it helps to sate a diehard C&amp;C fan's
appetite for something fresh, but that's as far as it goes. The
AI is too inconsistent in single player and multiplayer play is
too buggy to be acceptable. There aren't enough unit types, nor
are the ones present properly weighted to one another. If you
need a real time strategy fix and you already have Red Alert,
M.A.X., and Lords of the Realm 2, then you certainly could do
worse. If you're new to the genre and are considering being taken
in by KKND's pretty box and claims of superiority, keep on
walking down the aisle until you get to Red Alert and buy that
instead.&quot;<br>

Review</font><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
&quot;</font>Krush Kill and Destroy is yet another Dune 2 clone -
build an economy, train forces, attack and destroy the enemy
base. But some people can't seem to get enough of these games.
I'm one of them. Two generations after a nuclear catastrophe in
2079, the shelter dwellers in deep underground bunkers has
started drilling back up to the surface. The remaining mutated
survivors on the surface are keen to introduce them to a new
lifestyle... KKnD has a intriguing story. This was only a
shortened version.</p>

<p>Right after you've started playing, everything will seem very
quiet. But peace and harmony won't last long. After the enemy
spots you, they'll launch attack after attack. So, you'd better
start training your own forces fast. But if you only concentrate
on the military, you'll easily be defeated. The enemy starts with
a stronger economy and will therefore be able to train more
forces in the longer run.</p>

<p>In KKnD, there's only one resource that can be used to
construct buildings, expand the military etc. And that's oil. In
order to start drilling, you'll first have to build a power plant
to process it, and a machine factory to produce mobile oil rigs.
But remember, before your drilling operation is up and running,
you'll probably be attacked.</p>

<p>KKnD has one of the best computer AIs I've ever seen in a game
like this. It introduces something new - enemy retreating. If
your forces seems overwhelming, the computer won't attack. Or at
least it will retreat before it has lost all its units. The trick
in the beginning, is therefore to place all your military units
where you think you'll be attacked.</p>

<p>Beautiful SVGA graphics is becoming a standard these days, but
still, KKnD's graphics will probably impress you. The scenery
consists of nature like trees, rocks, deserts and rivers. Here
and there, you'll also find ruins from the old world. The
graphics were a bit jerky on my standard Pentium with a Cirrus
Logic video card. However, after I loaded a VESA driver, it
became much, much better (i.e. not jerky). The sounds are what
one is used to in games like this. KKnD has the game play
elements that makes this kind of game fun to play, plus it
introduces a few new things. The result? Another only slightly
different, but great, Dune 2 clone.<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><br>
