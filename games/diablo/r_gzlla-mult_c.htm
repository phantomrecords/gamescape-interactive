        name and password will be. Then push the

        in. However, if you get the notorious &quot;Sorry, but

        a number of problems. Either you need a password (or it
        is incorrect, check upper/lower case), have too much lag,
        are not high enough level to enter, or the game is full.

        the list will scroll down to the next group of active
        games, and you can try your luck there. <a
