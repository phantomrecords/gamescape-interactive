        relatively strong level (10 or 15) if you don't have much
        of a chance to get online or just want to break in the

        connection and choose a new multiplayer game over
        Battle.net via the Diablo menu. Enter a chat room </p>

        the Town Square at first, it is mostly for trading) and
        look for a bunch of guys near your level that are looking
        for adventure. When you see a person's name, it will show
        you a picture (depicting their class), a number
        indicating their character's level, possibly a number of
        red dots over the individual's picture, and a series of
        green, yellow, or red bars.<p><img

        red dots (max 3) tell which difficulty levels an

        eventually you are going to want to join the club. Beware
        of the colored bars to the right of an individual's
        name_1; They indicate how much lag a person has relative
        to you, so you would be better off playing with people
        that are in the green. Push F1 for a little primer on
        Battle.net and the chat interface, particularly for
        information on /msg, /squelch, /unsquelch, /whisper, and
        other commands. Once you've made a few friends, it's off
        to the depths of Hell! <a href="r_gzlla-mult_c.htm"><img
