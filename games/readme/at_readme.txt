        Windows 95 Users ----------------

        To ensure that Alien Trilogy runs correctly on your particular set up, we advise
        you to run WTRILOGY.EXE as this should help to make the game run
        smoothly. You may find, however, that in some rare occaisions the movies do
        not play correctly.

        -=-

        Troubleshooting ---------------

        Spacetec 360 users ------------------

        You must run SPWTRIL.EXE to use the Spacetec 360 with Alien Trilogy.

        -=-

        VFX-1 Headgear --------------

        Please note that this hardware will only work in 256 color mode.

        Ensure that you have properly calibrated your VFX-1 before playing the game.

        Memory ------

        If you find that you are getting out of memory errors while running Alien Trilogy
        or movies, try some of the following:

        1) Before running Alien Trilogy type SET DOS4GVM=TRILOGY.VMC (See
        below) 2) Installing the program to run in 256 colours. 3) Booting from a clean
        floppy disk. 4) Removing memory resident programs.

        -=-

        TRILOGY.VMC -----------

        You may need to edit this to get Trilogy to work on your system. The PhysMin is
        the amount of memory Trilogy requires. PhysMax is the amount of memory
        FREE on your system. We suggest you increase PhysMax until the program runs
        with the movies.

        -=-

        Video Cards -----------

        On some portable and laptop PCs you may find that your video set up will only
        run Alien trilogy in 256 colors.

        Alien Trilogy tries to work out your computer configuration in order to provide
        the best possible gameplay. On some rare occaisions, however, it may
        experience problems assessing your video set up and not initialize your card
        correctly. If you find this is the case, type:

        TRILOGY -nvd

        and the program will run in default VESA video modes.

        -=-

        If you cannot get Alien Trilogy to work in high color mode, try installing for 256
        colors.

        Check out our websites for any patches.

        Installation Notes ------------------

        During installation, a file called TRILOGY.BAT is placed in the root of your C:
        drive (C:\TRILOGY.BAT). This file will not only execute Alien Trilogy for you
        but is used by some programs to locate the game on your system and indicate
        that a successful installation has taken place.

        Removing this file will not stop you from playing the game but may make some
        periperhal programs believe that Alien Trilogy is not installed.

        -=-

        In-game speech --------------

        The speech samples are only available if you have enough memory available. If
        you do not, see MEMORY above.

        -=-

        Windows 95 and Gravis Pad --------------------------

        If you have installed your Gravis Pad Windows 95 drivers, Alien Trilogy may not
        detect you have this hardware connected to your system. Run the disable utility
        that comes with your pad and Alien Trilogy will work correctly when you enter
        the Options screen.

        -=-

        We hope you enjoy the game.
