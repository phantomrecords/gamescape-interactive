        that guarantees success without injury to themselves.
        Keeping with their cowardice disposition, whenever
        wounded they will retreat back into the Ether to heal

        Signum Vitiosum are stone creatures brought to life by

        adourned their building with statues. The stone Gargoyle
        was once placed on relegious structures as a means of
        scarring away demons or evil spirits. As a mockery of
        human weakness, the Lord of Terror, instilled them with
        life and used the stone form created by the humans as the
        very design of their new nemesis - The Gargoyle. Although
        they are not the most agile of foe, they can open doors
        and strike from a far distances. Their flying attack
        style also makes them difficult to his with range weapons
        or magic bolts. Fortunately they remain in stone form
        until disturbed by a stray arrow or an adventurer in
        close proximity. To your advantage attack them one at a
        time while taking care not to inadvertently hit an

        by these creatures twisted and warped their inner bodies

        diabolical species became capable of regurgitating these
        same substances a considerable distance toward an unlucky

        During the Great Conflict tremendous battles were fought
        in both the High Heavens and the Burning Hells. Both
        sides often carried the conflict deep within the realms
        of their enemies. During one epic battle into the very
        heart of Mephisto's fiery lair, a group of brave Seraphim
        warriors fronted an assault against the Lord of Hatred
        himself. One of these angelic soldiers made a bold attack
        and struck a fierce blow that caused the foul blood of
        Mephisto to rain upon the ground. Each drop of blood that
        fell seared through the crust of Hell itself and formed
        powerful demons of molten rock. These demons quickly rose
        to the aid of their master, and drove back the forces of
        Light to by striking them with thrown masses of lava that
        seared both flesh and bone with the intensity of the
        Burning Hells. The losses dealt were tremendous. These

        The legacy of Inarius, the corrupted Seraphim angel, is
        the origin of the existence of the Overloads. Inarius,
        the angel, was proud of his beauty and boasted loudly of
        his purity and worth. He eventually believed himself to
        be above both Angel and Demon, leaving the High Heavens
        to form his own dominion. He constructed a great
        Cathedral of mirrors and crystal, to which followers
        flocked, drawn by his numinous charm and wealth. In an
        arrogant show of power, Inarius and his armies attacked
        and lay slain the monks of the temple of Mephisto, the
        Lord of Hatred. In response, Mephisto is said to have
        appeared at the Cathedral of Inarius where he took the
        archangel and his followers captive. He bound Inarius
        with tremendous chains and slowly tore the wings from the
        back the angel. Great barbed hooks were then used to
        stretch out his once glowing skin. His features were
        distorted further by other vile powers. Many of the
        followers were then molded to match the bloated image of
        their leader, the now crippled angel. Grotesque as they
        are, the Overloads have considerable brawn hidden beneath
        their greasy flab. Resultantly, close combat is ill
        advised. Be guided instead by wisdom with the use of
        ranged weapons and magic.</font></td>

        Probably the single most dangerous type of adversary in
        the Dungeon, the Steel Lords are nearly impossible to
        take on in close combat. This fact applies mostly to
        groups of Steel Lords but an adventurer will hard pressed

        patiently plan to surround a target, staying cleverly out
        of hand-attack range until others arrive. Individually,
        their incredibly high dexterity makes them hard to hit.
        On the other hand they are relatively weak if encountered
        one at a time. If all else fails fight a running battle,
        pausing momentarily to hit the closest Lord, then
        resuming your retreat until only one or two remain. If
        the presence of the Hell Lord is suspected, proceed with
        slow steps. Moving slowly will alert fewer of them to
        your presence and thereby sway the odds to your favor.</font></td>

        You won't find a more cunning enemy than the Hell Spawn.
        Nimble and nippy they typically crowd near Counselors
        waiting for something to kill. Using projectiles of pure
        energy they chase, surround and attack their foe. They
        send rally after rally of indefensible magic bolts with
        stunning accuracy from very long distances. They are
        extremely agile as well as wise. They will run the
        instant you approach as if trying to lure you into a
        waiting ambush from other creatures. At the same time,
        however, if you run, they will give chase throughout the
        dungeon without letting up. Only strategy can save you
        from the Hell Spawn as they make quick defeat of magic
        assistants such as Golems.</font></td>

        The Counselors gather in groups, spread out across Hell.
        They wait until a foolish traveler happens on to their
        meeting, then they attack. They teleport from wherever
        they are to a spot that affords them a clear shot with a
        fireball. From there they send streams of flame at their
        distant opponent. They do not wait until getting hit to
        disappear. If danger approaches, they teleport away. It
        is always best to catch them off-guard instead or if
        there are too many, lure one or a few away from the group
        before pouncing. Counselors also tend to have a single
        objective on their mind - destroying you! This makes them
        an easy target for a Golem who can attack them as they
        hurl flames at you. If you can contiunually dodge the
        flames, do so. This keeps the Counselor in one place
        while your Golem gives him grief.</font></td>

        The Butcher is a foul creature, known as an Overload, who
        tortures then chops his victims to pieces. His magic
        cleaver is of the more powerful weapons present in the
        underworld of Diablo. Although he's a big character he is
        very fast indeed so be warned. Range weapons are of
        little use as a result. Instead pick up a good blade, a
        bag of healing potions, and say your prayers. You won't
        soon forget an encounter with the Butcher.</font></td>

        This is the undead existence of Laoric, a former King who
        died searching for his son. His death by magic has left
        him in command of fallen warriors of failed quests like
        his own. Be warned as this particularly fearsome opponent
        has no similarities with the once gentle man, Laoric. The
        Skeleton King can conjure spirits to embody newly created
        skeletons that will then attack while he watches. If you
        attack him in close quarters your foolishness will not
        last long. Also avoid large rooms for this battle for he
        will happily create Skeleton Archers who will spread out
        and sprawl arrows from all sides while as their master
        smashes down on you with his mighty blade. Only without
        the aid of the archers will you stand a chance to focus
        to destroying the Skeleton King and freeing the spirit of
        Laoric from his walking curse.</font></td>

        Using illusion and fear as their greatest weapons, the
        attendants to Diablo are formidable adversaries. They
        prefer to wait for their opponent to display a moment of
        weakness before they attack. Equally dangerous in the
        dark or in your dreams, they are the fears of man made
        flesh by Diablo's will. These nightmares lurk at the
        edges of mortal perception from the moment you take you
        first breath, and long to be with you when you take your
        last. If you manage to actually face the Lord of these
        tales may God be your guide as there are no accounts of
        any such encounters and likely never will as no one has
        ever returned to tell.</font></td>
