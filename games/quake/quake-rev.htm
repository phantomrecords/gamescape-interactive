No crap. No matter how much you hate to admit it, Duke 3D <br>
is superior to Quake, 'cause of: <br>
<br>
1. Cut scenes (All of them kick ass!) <br>
2. Badass bosses! <br>
3. There's 1 1/2 more bosses in DUKE3D! (Yes, 1 1/2... <br>
Shub is NOT A BOSS, it is a FUNGUS... it does LESS than <br>
MOTHER BRAIN! Whoa... that's an 80's trip...) <br>
4. The bosses ACTUALLY reappear in later episodes in <br>
DUKE3D! Oh, yeah, like having Shub in E3,M6 REALLY works... <br>
what a lame boss, I mean, what a DUMB IDEA for a boss... <br>
&quot;Okay, I'm going to wave my arms and send my minions after <br>
you... OOPS! What do you mean they're dead? Oh, well... <br>
may as well sit here, wave my arms again and be TELEFRAGGED <br>
LIKE A DUMBASS!&quot; <br>
<br>
Here's a list of feelings that came over me when I saw Shub <br>
for the first time... <br>
<br>
1. &quot;What the HELL is that? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!&quot; <br>
2. &quot;OH, NO! It can't die!&quot; <br>
3. &quot;Is it going to zap me now?&quot; <br>
4. &quot;Great... I wasted ALL my ammo on the bastard and I've <br>
got a SHAMBLER left... it didn't even hurt it!&quot; <br>
5. &quot;Yay. It's over. Can I take the CD out back and PISS ON <br>
IT? What a ripoff!&quot; <br>
<br>
OK, here's a vote for Dukeophiles or Quakeophiles: how many <br>
of you think that Id got LAZY with their bosses? Raise your <br>
right hand and state why Shub is lame... <br>
<br>
And Virgil, you are absolutely correct: that Fuhrer guy <br>
from Wolfenstein ROCKED! He would kick Shub's ass (if he <br>
wasn't dead), but would he kick the CYBERDEMON'S ASS? <br>
Ooooh! <br>
<br>
Allrighty you Quakeophiles! While it's fun reading this <br>
stuff, I've got a serious question for you: Why are there <br>
so many new weapons patches out? I feel if Id had done <br>
their #(%&amp;^@ job in the first place, then there would be NO <br>
NEED for a friggin' PATCH IN THE FIRST PLACE! And don't try <br>
to hand me that B.S. about, &quot;Uh, well people just wanted to <br>
change the original guns...&quot; Damn, I might still have the <br>
game on my hard drive if they had made PERFECT WEAPONS IN <br>
THE FIRST PLACE! What a waste of money... good thing I <br>
borrowed the CD from a friend and bought Tomb Raider instead <br>
:) Even DUKE3D must bow to the mighty Lara Croft!!! </font></p>
