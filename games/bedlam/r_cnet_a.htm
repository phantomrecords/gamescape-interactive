        such as scrubbing the toilets. But thinking such duties

        multiplayer mode. It does improve on the Crusader model,
        however, by omitting the slow pace and complicated plot
        elements. From your skewed, top-down perspective you comb
        the area looking for something to shoot at, blow up,
        and/or destroy. Here the thing to remember is the more
        pyrotechnics, the better. Nearly everything in Bedlam </font></td>

        off-limits areas, pressure pads to raise and lower
