        1) Virtual Pool v1.8.0.4 for Windows 95 (tm)
        Readme File
        =============================
        Setting Up Virtual Pool
        =============================
        To setup Virtual Pool, simply insert the Virtual Pool CD-Rom into your
        CD-Rom drive. The Windows 95 AutoRun feature will start the setup
        program for you and lead you through the necessary steps to setup the
        game on your system. If your AutoRun is disabled or or does not work
        for whatever reason, use the Run option from your Start Menu to locate
        and run
        d:\WINDOWS\SETUP.EXE
        (where d: is the letter of your CD-Rom device). Note that you must
        use the SETUP.EXE located in the \WINDOWS directory.

        Note: If you have a previous DOS or Windows 3.x version of Virtual
        Pool on your system, you should delete or uninstall it, respectively.
        If you wish to have both versions present on your system, make sure
        to install them into separate directories.

        Please take a few minutes to fill out the Electronic Registration form
        during your Setup. This lets us know what kinds of games you want to
        play as well as getting you lots of cool stuff like discounts and
        information on upcoming Interplay titles.
        If you skip the registration and decide to fill it out later, you can
        run it from the Virtual Pool for Windows program group.

        Note: You MUST have DirectX 3 or later installed on your system to
        play Virtual Pool. If you do not have DirectX 3 installed, the Setup
        program will ask you if you wish to install it. Select Yes. DirectX
        may replace some of your drivers with certified Microsoft drivers.
        Please see the Cautionary Notes below if this causes any problems on
        your system.

        ====================================================
        Compatibility Between Versions 1.67 and 1.8.0.4
        ====================================================
        The physics model for Virtual Pool has been improved for the Windows 95
        release. Because of this, there are some compatibility issues between
        the original DOS release and the new Win95 release:
        1) Remote Play: Remote Play is not available between the two versions.
        2) Save Games/ Trick Shots: The Win95 release can open saved games from
        the DOS version. Due to the changes in the physics model, it may be
        necessary to make slight adjustments to some of your trick shots if the
        shot is extremely precise. However, any necessary adjustments should be
        minor.
        The DOS version is not able to open games from the Win95 release.
        3) Scene Files: The scene files are not compatable between versions.

        ================================================
        Using the TCP/IP connection for DirectPlay
        ================================================
        Virtual Pool can be played over the internet using the TCP/IP option
        in the Remote Player setup. To start a game like this, you will need
        to first find out the IP Address of the player who will be hosting the
        game. Unfortunately, most internet providers dynamically assign an IP
        Address to each individual logon. For this reason, you will need to
        logon to the internet, get your IP Address and then get that info to
        the other player. Some suggested ways of communicating your IP address
        are as follows:
        1) If you both have extra phone lines, just call. This is the
        easiest way, but if you use your phone line to log on, its
        not much help.
        2) Arrange to meet your opponent in some sort of chat arena
        where you can quickly exchange the info and get into the
        game.
        3) E-mail the address.
        After you have the IP Address, connecting will be similar to any of the
        other remote play modes. One player should Create the game and the
        second player should Connect. The Connecting player will enter the IP
        Address of the hosting player. After a short pause while the systems
        connect, the game will be started and play will proceed as normal.

        =======================
        Cautionary Notes
        =======================
        * Uninstalling Virtual Pool. If you want to uninstall Virtual Pool,
        you must do it through Add/Remove Programs in your Control Menu. If
        you simply delete it from your system, the Registry files will remain
        and you will not be able to re-install the game.
        To uninstall, open your Control Panel which is located in Settings on
        your Start Menu. Double click on Add/Remove Programs located in the
        Control Panel. Scroll up and down through the list of programs until
        you find Virtual Pool for Windows. Highlight this and click Add/Remove
        in the lower right hand corner.
        If you have saved games, these will be left on your hard drive. These
        can be deleted like any other file after using Add/Remove Programs to
        remove Virtual Pool.

        * Do not remove the CD while a movie is playing. Because Virtual Pool
        is reading directly off the CD while the movies are playing, this can
        cause your game to hang or crash.

        * Do not change color palettes while playing Virtual Pool in a Desktop
        Window. Virtual Pool requires your system to be in 256 colors to play
        in a Desktop Window, changing this can cause unrecoverable errors in
        your pool game.

        * Closing programs using the Ctrl-Alt-Delete End Task function can cause
        problems when attempting to run the program later unless Windows has
        been restarted. To exit Virtual Pool, select Exit from the File menu.

        * When playing Virtual Pool over the Network or with a TCP/IP connection,
        make sure that the game is Created before the second player Connects to
        it. If the game is Created after the connecting player is viewing the
        available games list, the newly Created game may not appear. If this
        happens, the connecting player needs only to exit out and select Connect
        again.

        * If you have Windows Autorun feature enabled, and you insert your own
        music CD, Windows CD Player may start up and take control before
        Virtual Pool's CD Controller can. If this happens you can either use
        the Windows CD Player or close it and use the Virtual Pool CD
        controller.

        * We have experienced problem with Virtual Pool on Diamond Stealth 3D
        2000 video cards when using the v1.02 driver that comes with the card.
        This problem can be addressed by using the Windows driver.

        =====================
        TroubleShooting
        =====================
        Q: I have Direct X installed from one of my other games so I skipped the
        Direct X installation in the Setup program. But for some reason, I am
        having a bunch of problems with the game. Is there something wrong
        with my version and how can I fix this?
        A: Virtual Pool requires DirectX 3 which was just released recently.
        Your other game may have used an older version of DirectX and this could
        be the problem. Do update your DirectX 3 you can either remove Virtual
        Pool (using Add/Remove Programs -- see note above) and re-install it, or
        run the DirectX 3 installation directly by running
        d:\WINDOWS\REDIST\DXSETUP.EXE
        (where d: is the letter of your CD-Rom drive). This will update your
        version. And don't worry, DirectX is backwards compatible, so your old
        game should still work.

        Q: The gameplay isn't as smooth as I want it to be, what can I do to
        increase the performance of the game?
        A: First, you should try to run Virtual Pool without any other
        applications running in the background. If you need the other apps
        running, try turning off the background (this option is located in the
        under Game in the Preferences Menu). Lastly, you can lower the screen
        resolution. If you are running full screen, pick a lower resolution in
        the Display Modes menu. If you are running in Desktop mode, you can
        either scale down the size of the window or lower your Windows
        resolution.

        Q: I closed Virtual Pool with by using an End Task. The next time I
        ran it I received an error that said:
        Registry data damaged.
        Restoring default user preferences.
        What's that mean and why is my Registry data getting damaged?
        A: If Virtual Pool is terminated without properly exiting the game, it
        cannot properly de-initialize and save off user preferences. The game
        and your Registry are not damaged, they just were not saved off
        properly. Always remember to exit out of pool from within the game
        window or File menu.

        Q: I had to install DirectX 3, but after my system was restarted by
        the Setup program, I found out that some of my newer drivers were
        replaced by DirectX with older ones. What's going on?
        A: DirectX 3 has its own set of drivers that have been certified for
        use with it. In some situations, you may have a driver that is newer
        than the one from DirectX or one that isn't certified. If this occurs,
        you can either use DirectX's driver, or re-install your previous driver
        after DirectX has been installed. 

        Q: I've read the readme and I'm still having problems. Where can I go
        to get more help.
        A: Never fear. Interplay Technical Support is always available to help.
        You can reach us via e-mail, the Interplay BBS, the Interplay Web Site,
        by telephone, or mail. See Section 4 of this readme for all the numbers
        and addresses.

        ========================================================================
        2) Virtual Pool v1.67 DOS/Windows 3.x
        Readme File

        ========================
        Installation
        ========================
        From DOS
        Insert the Virtual Pool disk into your CD drive. Type d:\DOS\INSTALL,
        where 'd' is the letter of your CD-Rom drive. The first time you
        run Virtual Pool a configuration program will ask you to set up
        all the options for your video display and sound card.

        From Windows
        Insert the Virtual Pool disk into your CD drive and run
        d:\WINDOWS3.1X\SETUP.EXE, where 'd' is the letter of your CD-Rom drive,
        using the RUN selection of the Program Manager File menu.

        ========================
        Memory Managers
        ========================
        Virtual Pool does not require a memory manager, but should run ok with
        all of them in most configuations.

        You may have problems running Virtual Pool with QEMM.
        To disable QEMM, push ALT while the system is booting.

        ========================
        Sound Cards
        ========================
        Although the Virtual Pool movies can output sound to a variety of sound
        cards, Virtual Pool only uses Sound Blaster digitized sound for effects
        during the game. If you have a different sound card, make sure that its
        Sound Blaster emulation is turned on. Also, make sure that the BLASTER
        environment variable contains the correct settings. See your sound
        card's installation procedures for more information.

        ========================
        Video Drivers
        ========================
        Virtual Pool can be run at higher resolutions with the 3DVX video
        drivers. The drivers are graphics chip specific. If you don't know what
        chip is on your video card, try using auto-detection in the config
        program. 

        If a chip specific driver does not work, try the VESA Planar Multi Page 
        driver. If that does not work, use the VESA Linear Single Page driver.
        If all else fails, use the VGA driver.

        Video memory requirements for drivers:
        320x240 VGA driver 256 KB
        640x480 3DVX chip specific drivers 1 MB
        1024x768 3DVX chip specific drivers 2 MB
        640x480 VESA Planar Multi Page 1 MB
        1024x768 VESA Planar Multi Page 2 MB
        640x480 VESA Single Page 512 KB
        1024x768 VESA Single Page 1 MB

        New drivers will be made available on the Interplay BBS (see below).

        There are hardware bugs in some early versions of the S3801/805 chipsets.
        You may see pixels reversed in columns on the screen. The accelerator
        may not work on some chips. There is no fix for these bugs.

        If there isn't a driver for your board, let us know by posting a message
        on the Interplay BBS. If we get a sufficient number of requests for a
        chip, we'll try to write a driver for it. ISA graphics boards will not
        be supported because they lack the necessary performance for Virtual Pool
        at high resolution.

        The movie player uses a VESA mode. If you can't play movies and get a
        message that the graphics mode can't be set, try installing a VESA
        driver.

        =======================
        Running under Windows
        =======================
        To play Virtual Pool under Windows, use the SETUP program to install the
        game, and start the game by clicking on the Virtual Pool Icon. Starting
        Virtual Pool from a DOS window is not recommended.

        Be sure to quit any other Windows programs BEFORE starting Virtual Pool,
        as other applications may cause audio and video problems in the game.
        There may not be enough memory to run Virtual Pool with other
        applications running.

        Virtual Pool is a DOS program. The Windows setup program, and the
        ability to launch the program from an icon in Windows are provided as a
        convenience. If you experience problems while playing under Windows,
        exit Windows and try running Virtual Pool from DOS.

        ======================
        Known Windows Problems
        ======================
        The ET4000/W32 Accelerated Chipset will not work under WINDOWS. If you 
        have a card with this chipset use the non-accelerated driver if you are
        running under Windows.

        Some older Sound Blaster and Media Vision cards will not function under
        WINDOWS. If you're having problems getting the sound to work while
        playing from WINDOWS, and are getting a "sound device in use message",
        close any application that may be using sound. If you still get the
        message the problem is a sound driver bug. You can probably download an
        updated sound driver from your board manufacturer. Creative Labs has a
        new driver for older Sound Blaster cards.

        Selecting Sound Blaster sound when configuring Virtual Pool under Windows
        may cause the movie player to hang. If you configure Virtual Pool in
        Windows and select Sound Blaster, restart Windows before playing any
        movies. You must hit ESC to bypass the movies at the start of Virtual
        Pool.

        If Virtual Pool does not work after a screen saver has been activated,
        disable your screen saver. The Windows screen saver can be disabled by
        going to Main, select Control Panel, select Desktop, and change the name
        of the screen saver to None.

        The Windows setup program does not set the icon properties correctly 
        when installing under Windows 95. After installation set program name to
        "path"\vpool.pif, where "path" is the destination directory you specified
        during setup. The work directory should also be set to "path".

        ========================
        Trick Shots
        ========================
        If you make your own trick shots they will appear in the game under the
        name you saved them under, but the names in DOS will be different. The
        naming convention for trick shots in DOS is GAMExxxx.PT, where the x's
        represent numbers which are used for identification. As you save shots,
        these numbers increment automatically. On the trick shot LOAD menu,
        these numbers are printed to the right of each trick shot to help you
        identify the shots from DOS.

        ========================================================================
        3) Manual Addenda

        The 8-Ball rules incorrectly state that fouling on the 8-Ball loses.
        The rules should read that:
        Scratching when playing the 8-Ball loses.
        Fouling when pocketing the 8-Ball loses.
        Any other foul when playing the 8-Ball does not lose.

        The following entries should have been noted under Menu Items (p.5-6)
        and were not listed. Both are available in the Win95 version.

        Load Scene
        Loads alternate background scene files.

        Video Statistics
        Show video statistics. These can help you select the best resolution to
        run Virtual Pool in. The statistics shown are:

        Video Mode - either Desktop Window or Full Screen
        Resolution - shows current resolution for Full Screen mode
        or size of window for Desktop Window mode
        Buffering - single, double, or triple
        Buffer Memory - system or video
        Frame Rate - frame rate of last shot

        Your frame rate should be at least 20 frames per second. 

        When running in Desktop Window mode, the only statistic that affects
        performance is Buffer Memory. It is preferable to use video memory.
        If your using system memory it's because your video card does not
        have sufficient memory.

        When running in Full Screen Mode, the Buffering and Buffer Memory
        statistic affect performance. The larger the Buffering number the
        better, i.e. triple is better than double. If the Buffer Memory
        statistic is system memory, there is a huge performance loss. Try
        lowering your resolution until the Buffer Memory is video memory.

        Under Display Modes (p.10) for the Win95 version, the manual incorrectly
        lists a number of display modes. The display modes that are available
        are system specific and are determined by Virtual Pool at run time.

        The manual incorrectly states (p.34) that Miscall is not available during
        Remote Play. Miscall may be available depending on the game type.

        Quit current match (p.34) is available if you are the shooter
        (for Win95).

        Change Turn (p.34) is available in Remote Play (for Win95).

        Modem and Network Play
        If the Software contains modem or network play, you may play the
        Software via modem transmission with another person or persons directly
        without transmission through a third party service or indirectly
        through a third party service only if such service is an authorized
        licensee of Interplay. For the purposes of this license, a "third
        party service" refers to any third party service which provides a
        connection between two or more users of the Software, manages,
        organizes, or facilitates game play, translates protocols, or otherwise
        provides a service which commercially exploits the Software, but does
        not include a third party service which merely provides a telephonic
        connection (and nothing more) for modem or network play. Authorized
        licensee services are listed on the Interplay Productions World Wide
        Web Site located at http://www.interplay.com. This limited right to
        transmit the Software expressly excludes any transmission of the
        Software or any data streams thereof on a commercial basis, including,
        without limitation, transmitting the Software by way of a commercial
        service (excepting those specific commercial services licensed by
        Interplay) which translates the protocols or manages or organizes game
        play sessions. If you would like information about obtaining a
        pay-for-play or commercial license to the Software, please call
        Interplay Productions at (714) 553-6655.
