        first thing you want to do in Diablo is to get a decent
        character worked up. If you plan on playing multiplayer
        as much as many people, you will eventually have a very
        high level character, so you should plan for it. While I
        feel that all three character classes are well balanced,
        it seems that Warriors have an advantage at the
        beginning, Rogues in the middle, and Sorcerers towards
        the end. As a result, I would lean towards creating a
        sorcerer </p>

        if you plan on using it for the long term, but keep in
        mind that sorcs tend to be quite weak in the early
        levels. All three character classes have their own
        strengths and weaknesses, and all three are crucial to a
        good multiplayer crusade. <p><b>Single Play in

        This allows you to take all the experience and equipment,
        and is not very difficult. In order to do this, you don't
        need to use your ISP or connect to Battle.net. All you
        have to do is choose &quot;Multiplayer Game&quot; from
        the menu, create a character, and then start a modem or
        direct connection game. Since multiplayer games are
        dynamic, the game will start right up and you can play
        all you want, although the computer is probably expecting
        someone to connect later in the game by <a
