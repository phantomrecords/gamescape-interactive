        color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">: The sequel to the original
        Space Hulk is superior in graphics and sound effects, but
        it misses the mark on gameplay. My other complaint is
        that enemies, once up close, kill you in a single blow.
        Few have an exploitable weakeness. Look, let's face it,
        wouldn't you be better prepared if you were a <em>real</em>
        Space Marine.... continued below...</font><font

        time period. The story basically tells of a massive
        battle leaving behind deserted and abandoned chunks of
        floating metal now called Space Hulks. Similar to the
        Aliens movies and the Buck Rogers RPG game Countdown to
        Doomseday, these ships have been infested with nasty
        mutants. Adding to this are Space Marines who have
        weapons like you but unfairly and unlike you, are
        unlimited in number.</font><font face="Arial"> </font></p>

        face="Arial">More gripes?</font></a><font color="#FFFFFF"
        face="Arial"> Yep. This game is meant to appeal to the
        strategist, meaning the one who likes to solve problems
        using reason and cunning. In Space Hulk 2, the enemies
        have Ship entries that can't be closed. What a let down
        for an aspiring strategist! Geepers, it's as if they
        don't run out of gas flying from ship to ship to fight
        you. <em>They can't possibly be that well financed.</em> </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">The bottom line is
        this: <em>If you find Doom too easy then perhaps Space
        Hulk 2 is for you. If not, look elsewhere - this one
        could leave you a triffle miffed!</em> </font><a

        face="Arial"> <em>&quot;In fact there is an
        inexchaustible supply of aliens fed by variuos teleport
        chambers. Also, in most missions you run into the same
        ones too many times... those pesky ones. There isn't
        enough variety. Gameplay is different. It's like a
        first-person perspective game, except that you are able
        to &quot;see&quot; through the eyes of other marines in
        your team as you control them. The entire empetus of
        Space Hulk is at a strategically elevated level compared
        to games like doom or quake. In the end however, due
        mainly to the endless supply of aliens, the ease of dying
        without a save, and the slowness of the game, the attempt
        at compromise between a first-person action game and a
        turn-style strategy didn't work for me. High on
        atomspher, high on mood but not so much on play. Another
        point is that some missions require you to retrieve an
        object and having done so still don't end forcing you to
        quit and start again. There must be a bug in that.</em></font></p>
