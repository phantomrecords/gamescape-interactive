        sequel to anything is never certain until the moment of
        its release. However, in the case of <i>Civilization II</i>,
        or <i>Civ II</i> as most fans will probably refer to it,
        I doubt that Sid Meier and his talented crew ever had a
        thing to fear. It may sound the same as the original <i>Civ</i>,
        but Sid Meier has added a few touches that make playing
        this game just as addictive, if not more so, than the
        original. For starters, the graphics have improved
        significantly. Gone are the static colour squares with a
        number representing </td>
        <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="190" height="346">the
        number of citizens in a given city. Now, we have graphic
        representations of huts, towers, and buildings that grow
        in size and sophistication as your society advances. The
        same goes for the mobile units which strike out into
        parts unknown to search out new lands, hostile enemies,
        and potential allies. There are more combat choices, such
        as marines, paratroopers, various ships and aircraft, and
        missiles such as nuclear bombs. Normally, I'm a peaceful,
        non-confrontational person, </td>
        <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="190" height="346">but
        I have to admit that when the Zulus got out of hand and
        wouldn't respect my borders, the nuclear fallout and
        resulting mushroom cloud over one of their cities did
        give me a guilty twinge of satisfaction. <p><img

        for all you potential Caesars, Lincolns, or Ghengis Khans
        who have dreamed at one time of ruling the world, this is
        the game for you. For all the others who have purchased
        the original <i>Civilization</i>, you will not be
        disappointed. A solid <a href="r_gmsm_b.htm"><img
