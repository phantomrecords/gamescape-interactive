color="#004080" size="5" face="Arial"><strong><u>$15.00 For 14
Days!</u></strong> That's right - the Gamescape Testdrive just
grew to 14 days! Now you have even more time to organise the fun!</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#004080" size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Here's why
you may want to consider a new 14-Day Testdrive:</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">If you ever bought a game you
didn't like then you know already why we offer a Testdrive.
Nothing is more frustrating then wasting money on a
&quot;so-called' popular game that just isn't what it's cracked
up to be! And chances are you would have given up $20.00 just to
avoid the mistake! And Testdrives are almost always in stock
since they rotate so often so you don't have to wonder if we have
it or not. We do. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The other thing is that, even if
you wanted to order a game from the local store, you'd have to
spend time phoning around to find it, then order it and wait for
it to arrive because the one you want is usually out of stock,
then once you finally get it you might not like it! Instead of
going through that just click a button below and get a Testdrive
by tomorrow (in most cases)! The difference with <em><strong>our</strong></em>
Testdrive service is that we send <em><strong>and</strong></em>
pickup the game instead of making you come to us! And the
Testdrive usually arrives overnight or in Christchurch sometime
the same day (morning orders)! But read on before making a
decision.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Testdrives have an associated cost
for us which we must charge to you. That cost currently amounts
to the $20.00, which is basically delivery and pickup. That means
that we do not offer the discounted &quot;testdrive
conversion&quot; anymore! So you'll want to consider the value of
trying a game before buying it because the cost of the Testdrive
is non-refundable. However, keep in mind that our Testdrives are
now 14 days instead of 7, and thats two full weeks of gaming is
plenty of time to organise the fun and decide if the game is for
you!</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The final note is that Testdrives
do not include manuals as deterrence to software piracy. However,
most games now feature easy installations and help files. The
install program will be </font><font color="#004080" size="3"
face="Arial"><strong>Setup.exe</strong></font><font size="3"
face="Arial"> or </font><font color="#004080" size="3"
face="Arial"><strong>Install.exe </strong></font><font size="3"
face="Arial">and help file will be </font><font color="#004080"
size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Readme.txt</strong></font><font
size="3" face="Arial"> or </font><font color="#004080" size="3"
face="Arial"><strong>Install.txt</strong></font><font size="3"
face="Arial">.</font></p>
