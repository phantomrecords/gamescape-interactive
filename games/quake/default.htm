say one more thing about Quake I'll scream! It's just Doom! No
matter what you say, how you cut it, Quake is Doom reincarnated
like Jason or Freddy. And now there's millions of Quake-Doom
alikes! There was so much hype about this game before it was
released that it isn't funny that so many imitations of the
&quot;Doom-style&quot; game are now available! </font><font

Anytime a player knows that much about a game credit must be
given. Yes Quake is popular. There are even re-releases of it's
predessesor like Final Doom, Ultimate Doom, Doom 95, Doom II,
Doom Unleashed. Although there is a following it doesn't mean
that Quake meets the quality standard expected of it. Instead it
sounds more like the marketing forces behind the game did a very
good job. It also sounds to me like somebody sold the rights to
reproduce Doom or Quake to every marketing company that exists
which is why there are now so many permutations of Quake and
Doom...&quot; </font><a href="../titanic/test.htm"><font

release, Quake. The gaming audience has been waiting for this
release for over a year and it's been worth the wait. [</font><a

Player Review<br>
</strong></font><font size="3">&quot;Duke is way better than
Quake. I just downloaded the shareware version of Quake, and I
find that it is maybe a little better in graphics, but the
gameplay in Quake is way, way worse. I hate how you have to go to
the console, to type in a command. I like the nailgun, and some
of the other weapons, but overall I just don't like it. Sure it
is another Doom killer, but definetely not a Duke killer.&quot;</font></p>

Player Review<br>
</strong></font>&quot;I think Quake is a better game. The
graphics are more intense as is the music and the enviroment fits
the scenario. Duke sometimes lacks these qualities and intenet
play on Duke is horrible...Try find an internet game of Duke or
try getting one started on Kahn or Kali... you'll find its
impossible or nearly anyway.Quake is easy to find and easy to
join. Try playing Quake with throwing axes or with the Flame
Thrower and you may change your mind. Quake is a much more
versatile game.<font size="3">&quot;</font></p>

Player Review<br>
</strong></font>&quot;Duke is better than Quake. For one thing it
has clearer color. Quake has way too many shades of earth tones
and it is way easier to play a game of Duke over the modem than
Quake. I haven't got Quake's modem to modem play to even work yet
and it is very annoying to shell out $50 <font size="2"
face="Arial">U.S.</font> for a product that doesn't perform as
promised. Quake was supposed to make it easy to play multiplayer
games, but I guess this didn't include modem to modem games. They
probably figured that wasn't important seeing how they hyped up
the Quake Internet thing. But anyway, Internet play is too slow
with both Duke and Quake so you can't even factor this into the
equation. If anyone knows how to get faster Internet play with a
28.8 modem, please enlighten me. As a standalone game, I can run
Duke in 640x480 with no problems, but Quake is about half that
resolution. Quack has its moments, but if I was stranded on a
desert island I'd wish for the Duke.&quot;</p>
