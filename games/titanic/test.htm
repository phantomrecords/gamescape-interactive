        And if I have to say one more thing about Quake I'll
        scream! It's just Doom! No matter what you say, how you
        cut it, Quake is Doom reincarnated like Jason or Freddy.
        And now there's millions of Quake-Doom alikes! There's
        Final Doom, Ultimate Doom, Doom 95, Doom II, and Doom
        Unleashed, Doom the 13th, Quake Goes To Hell (okay maybe
        those last two are made up). Sounds to me like somebody
        sold the Doom</td>
        <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="190" height="346">rights
        to the world's hungriest marketing company! Enough is
        enough! I mean the play is not anything special if you
        ask me. Personally I like Doom I better than Doom II and
        Quake. The coolest thing about playing Doom is not the
        creatures, it's the background music. The music is cool.
        Everyone knows that. Even when anti-gamers see someone
        playing it they crowd up say &quot;hey that music is
        cool.&quot; So what's Quake got? Music? <br>
        It didn't strike my &quot;cool cord.&quot; Maybe you'll
        disagree or </td>
        <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="190" height="346">perhaps
        you didn't play the first Doom. Either way you can get
        the demo here if you like (it's huge though and by the
        time you finish downloading hell might freeze over). When
        you get it you'll basically see a darker version of Doom.
        Why not just get Doom and then search the net for the
        infinite alternative worlds you play for that one. I've
        played the Barney one, Simpsons one, and I hear there's
        Beavis and Buthead and Star Wars world. In the Star Wars
        one you get a lightsaber! There's like a new <a
