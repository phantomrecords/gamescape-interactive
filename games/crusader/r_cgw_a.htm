        the middle is the meat of the game. The mission
        environments are massive, yet they are constructed in
        such a way that you'll rarely get confused. That this can
        be done without it seeming like you're being led by the
        hand is quite a feat. Once in the mission, Crusader is a
        relatively simple game. Which is not to say it's easy.
        It's simple in that you can grasp the mechanics and
        nuances of the gameplay rather quickly, and they remain
        consistent throughout the play experience.</td>
