        and even some things from the original <b><i>C&amp;C</i></b>.
        Unlike <b><i>Warcraft 2</i></b>, instead of using the
        higher resolution to put more detail into the units and
        structures, the sprites are quite small so that you can
        see more of the playing field on screen at once. On the
        plus side, there is noticeably much less slow down when
        lots of units are moving, than with <b><i>RA</i></b>.<p><img

        professionally, with great imagination. The backdrops
        too, are realistically post-apocalypse, and add nicely to
        the overall theme of the game. One of the main (but hotly
        debated) criticisms of <b><i>RA</i></b> was that the two
        warring sides were unevenly matched - <b><i>KKnD</i></b>
        seems to have chosen the <b><i>Warcraft 2</i></b> route
        to avoid that one, by making each side's units generally
        hold the same defensive and offensive attributes (with a
        few exceptions).<p><img src="../../images/spacer.gif"

        objectives to accomplish in each of the missions
        throughout <b><i>KKnD</i></b>. In fact, I was very
        surprised at how few of the first 6 or 7 missions
        actually required you to establish and build up your
        base; most involved you starting with a set number of
        troops, and then moving them out to either protect
        convoys, destroy all enemy presence or rescue stranded
        soldiers.<p><b>Interface and New Features </b></p>
