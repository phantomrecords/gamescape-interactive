        is one other threat of theft, due to a bug that Blizzard
        has yet to fix. If a player loses their Internet
        connection, the current game usually stays active, but
        all other players drop out. As a result, some players
        will kill their net connection as soon as you put your
        item on the ground, thus kicking you out of their game
        and giving them a free item. This is a new kind of
        thievery, and is much harder to prevent. However, it is
        reassuring that in the higher levels, characters tend to

        many rings and other such items that are inferior to
        those you are already using, and cash is available in
        abundance later in the game. As a result, it is usually
        best to give away such trinkets to lower level
        characters, since the items have little value to you and
        clog up your inventory. Other players will appreciate it,

        is a nice way to counterbalance the occasional PKer or
        thief. In addition, you will find that other players are
        likely to do the same for you, giving away unneeded or

        is the discovery. Try to form a group of friends and
