        of Warcraft fighting or racing to control resources.
        Don't expect the tremendous depth of Betrayal at Krondor.
        Instead, expect an excellent mix of both, for just the
        right blend of fighting action, and RPG quest. And it's
        all animated beautifully, and it sounds lovely. Add to
        that a smooth interface that does all the work but lets
        you make the decisions (though it occasionally suffers
        from Warcraft's &quot;No wait! I didn't want you to go

        you've got one addictive little mother of a game. Play
        this one, and you'll find yourself thinking about it
        constantly. You'll be at work or standing in a check-out
        line thinking about how much more gold you need to buy a
        magic axe, or how you should think about boosting your
        magic abilities with your next level up.<p align="left"><img
