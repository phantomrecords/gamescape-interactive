        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Elves</b> <br>
        The elves of Cerilia are a graceful but reclusive race,
        suspicious of humankind. Early in Cerilia's history, the
        elves contested human settlement of the continent's vast
        forests, and a strong current of ill will toward the
        human nations still runs strong in the elven woods. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">There is only one race of Cerilian
        elves; they call themselves the Sidhelien (SHEE-lin). The
        Sidhelien hold court in deep, mist-wreathed vales in the
        darkest hearts of the ancient Cerilian forests. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Elves stand as tall as humans, but
        are far more slender and graceful. Most average 5 1/2 to
        6 feet in height, but weigh only 120 to 140 pounds. All
        have fair skin and dark hair, and their features are
        exquisitely fine. Elves possess an unearthly beauty, and
        their perfect voices can hold a mortal spellbound.
        Unfortunately, elves are too mindful of their superiority
        and treat outsiders with coldness or condescension. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Cerilian elves are creatures of
        faerie dust and starlight, gifted with immortality and
        powers of mind and body beyond those of humankind. They
        are a force for neither good nor evil; an elven wood can
        be perilous for human travelers, but even more so for
        goblins or gnolls. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The elven heart is unfathomable to
        nonelves; they're moved to wild delight, dark melancholy,
        or burning rage with only the slightest cause. More than
        anything else, elves are unpredictable, doing what
        pleases them from one moment to the next. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Half-elves</b> <br>
        From time to time, a particularly handsome or beautiful
        human with courage and a gracious manner may walk among
        the Sidhelien unscathed. A few humans have even been
        accepted as equals in the elven courts. Mortals (by elven
        standards) quickly become lost in the elven spell; the
        years reel by in splendor and celebration, while the
        world outside comes to a halt or leaps centuries ahead.
        Such a mortal may return home to find that only a single
        night has passed, or that a hundred years have flown by.
        More often than not, a mortal's life runs out in a
        heartbeat. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Half-elves are the rare children of
        these unusual men and women and their elf partners. The
        elves regard such offspring as Sidhelien and welcome them
        fully in elf society. Humans, however, tend to be
        suspicious of half-elves, referring to them as bewitched
        or as changelings; it is rare for half-elves to leave the
        elven woods. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Halflings</b> <br>
        The halflings aren't a numerous people, but they are
        found nearly everywhere humans live. Only a handful of
        humans know the secret of the halflings' origin: they
        once dwelled in the Shadow World, a realm of faerie
        enchantment parallel to Cerilia. That realm was poisoned
        by the rise of the Usurper, a gathering evil that
        corrupted their homeland, and they fled to the daylight
        world to escape his power. A small number of halflings
        arrived in Cerilia in time to witness the battle of Mount
        Deismaar. In the early years of the Anuirean Empire, the
        halflings left their homes one family at a time,
        virtually trickling into the human lands. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Living among their larger
        neighbors, halflings don't see the sense in a government
        larger than a small village or extended family, and are
        happy to count themselves as citizens of whatever land
        surrounds them. It's not unusual to find a handful of
        halfling farmers near a human village, or a neighborhood
        of halfling craftsmen in a larger town. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Halflings usually adopt the
        language, culture, and customs of the Big Folk around
        them while keeping a few aspects of their own culture.
        They feel free to use weapons in defense of their homes
        or families, but will never take up arms against each
        other. Halflings consider fisticuffs the only acceptable
        form of violence against other halflings. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Cerilian halflings stand about 3
        1/2 feet tall and resemble small humans. They tend to be
        slightly stocky, and are fond of creature comforts. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Humans</b> <br>
        Humans are the most populous race in Cerilia and inhabit
        every part of the continent. Five human nationalities or
        cultures currently exist: the Anuireans, the Khinasi, the
        Brechts, the Rjurik, and the Vos. <b>Anuireans</b> are
        native to the southwestern portion of Cerilia. The
        ancient Anuireans were a fair-skinned, red-haired people,
        but over centuries of extensive contact with other
        cultures, Anuireans have lost most defining physical
        characteristics. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Anuirean society is semifeudal and
        based on a class of free farmers and craftsmen. Regents
        (rulers of domains) are usually titled nobles. Anuireans
        respect nobility and look to their leaders to protect
        them from the barbarians and savages who surround the
        states of the old Empire. Commoners identify strongly
        with their lords, and the dealings and alliances of the
        noble families are topics of continuous discussion
        throughout Anuirean lands. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The <b>Brechts</b> inhabit
        north-central Cerilia. They tend to be short and stocky,
        with dark hair and eyes. Early in their history, they
        were under the rule of Anuirean governors, and Brecht
        nobility declined drastically in power and importance.
        When the Anuirean Empire fell and the Brechts gained
        independence, the guilds and merchants came into power.
        The nobility is weak in Brechtur, and several states have
        declared themselves republics. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The Brechts believe in free
        enterprise, and Brecht society revolves around wealth.
        The Brechts have a fierce love of independence and a
        tradition of self-reliance; they don't wait for their
        lords or rulers to solve problems for them. Commerce and
        trade are expressions of this belief, and Brecht
        commoners owe their first loyalty to guilds and
        companies. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Khinasi</b> characters are
        native to the region known as Khinasi. They're descended
        from the Basarji, and speak the language of the same
        name. The Basarji arrived in Cerilia from lands across
        the Sea of Dragons. They are tall and lanky, with
        aquiline features and dark eyes. Their complexions range
        from a light coffee to a dark brown color. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Unlike the other human cultures,
        the Khinasi have no fear of magic. The study of magic is
        considered the noblest of callings, and the Khinasi
        universities devoted to magic are the finest in Cerilia.
        Like the Brechts, Khinasi commoners are traders and
        merchants, but an individual's decorum, hospitality, and
        conduct are far more important than gross wealth. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The <b>Rjurik</b> inhabit the taiga
        forests and highlands of northwestern Cerilia. They are a
        tall, broad-shouldered people with blond or red hair and
        fair complexions. Men and women most commonly wear their
        hair in long braids. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The Rjurik are stubborn
        individualists who don't swear fealty to anyone but their
        own kin; the family is the most important part of Rjurik
        life. Most Rjurik follow the god Erik, a druidical power,
        and druids are revered throughout Rjurik society as
        teachers, leaders, and advisers. All Rjurik have a deep
        respect and love for Cerilia's wilds, and carefully avoid
        over-hunting or clearing virgin forest. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The <b>Vos</b> are a barbaric race
        from the cold mountains and forests of northeastern
        Cerilia. They are tall, thick-boned people with flat
        features, light eyes, and sallow skin. Male warriors are
        fond of shaving their heads and wearing long, drooping
        mustaches. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The Vos have a rigid code of face
        and honor that demands blood for even unintentional
        insults. Their leaders are war-chieftains known as <i>tsarevos</i>
        who are advised by the priests of the grim Vos gods.
        Almost all Vos men are warriors and hunters-other
        professions are considered unmanly. Vos women are by
        custom greatly limited in their freedoms, although a few
        women have succeeded as warriors or tsarevas. <br>
