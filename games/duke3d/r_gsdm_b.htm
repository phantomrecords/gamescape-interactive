        course, realistic levels are all very well, but mean
        nothing if the level design's crap. Well, thankfully, <b><i>DN3D</i></b>
        manages to hold it's own in that area. There are all
        manner of things to jump on and duck behind, there are
        darkened corridors, places to conceal nasty monsters. A
        subway train turns up on one level. It's difficult to say
        exactly what it is that makes a good level, but <b>3D
        Realms</b> seem to have cracked it. Each level has a </p>

        <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="190" height="346">number
        of features which fit in with that location. Enter the
        cinema on the first level, and you'll find monsters
        popping out from behind the seats. Blow them away, and
        you're safe, or are you? There's a smashing sound, and
        you'll find that the baddies in the projection room have
        smashed the window and are now blasting away at you.

        eh?), where you can relieve yourself for a health bonus,
        or if you're feeling particularly destructive, blow up
        the urinals, and smash the mirror. Open the cubicle
        doors, and you might just find a bad guy doing his
        business. A blast from the shotgun, and he's dead before
        he can reach the bog roll. The levels are be-decked with
        features and effects like this. Go into the sushi-bar and
        you'll find a karaoke mike, which you can sing into, and
        even a food-conveyor, with assorted body parts. Yum! <a
