        bad news: You have to pay for ordnance out of your
        pocket. The good news: The game auto- configures your
        craft to stay within budget. There are lots of options
        ranging from needler guns that barely kick up dust, to
        Hades bombs that reduce whole regions to raging
        firestorms. </font><p><img src="../../images/spacer.gif"

        dropped off at the insertion point by a great gleaming
        aircraft. Gameplay is simplicity itself: One mouse button
        for movement, one for firing. The game makes clearly

        challenges. That's not to say there aren't puzzles.
        Objectives are often protected, remote or both. You'll
        find yourself combing the landscape in search of
        teleporters to unlock off-limits areas, pressure pads to
        raise or lower sections of terrain, and control switches
        to disable forcefields.</font><p><img
