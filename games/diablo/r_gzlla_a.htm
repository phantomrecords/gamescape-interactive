        width="27" height="15">So why does Diablo succeed where
        so many others have failed? There are several reasons.
        First, and maybe foremost, is the wonderful design and
        implementation of the game's interface. The lower portion
        of your screen tells you what you need to know at a
        glance: most importantly your health and mana levels. The
        upper portion of the screen is your window to the world
        of Diablo, where you perform all </p>

        <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="190" height="346">real-time
        actions in the game. Now, other games have at least
        accomplished this much (even Doom), but not the
        simplicity and ingenuity of your character's pop-up
        screens.<p><img src="../../images/spacer.gif" width="27"
        height="15">Many types of information cannot be included
        on your main character screen simply for lack of real
        estate. These include your inventory, spellbook, and
        character attributes. To solve this, other RPGs have
        usually made you visit a special room or (worse) </p>

        you out of the action completely to enter an inventory or
        separate screen, do your business, then return to the
        game. Diablo ingeniously uses popup screens that cover
        only half of the action window at a time, that you can
        access by pressing the corresponding button on the lower
        portion of the main screen. Huh? Ok, picture this: you're
        fighting a gang of skeletons, and you realize that you
        forgot to wear that new armor you just bought. It would
        help your cause considerably. What do <a
