<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Running Quake<br>
-------------<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">DOS: To launch Quake from
the DOS Prompt, go to the Quake directory and<br>
simply type &quot;QUAKE&quot; &lt;ENTER&gt;. (no quotes)<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Windows 95: To launch Quake
in single player mode, double click on the file<br>
QUAKE.EXE From Windows Explorer. To run Quake in Multi-Player
mode using<br>
the TCP/IP protocol, first check your network settings to ensure
the<br>
protocol is installed, then double click on the Q95.BAT file to
launch the<br>
game. In this version (v0.91) there is a minor bug that will
cause the<br>
Q95.BAT file to exit the first time you run it, without running
Quake.<br>
Merely double-click on that file again and it will work.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Audio Setup<br>
-----------<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">When using a Sound Card with
Quake, there are a few setup steps which must<br>
be taken. First, the &quot;BLASTER&quot; environment variable
setting must be in your<br>
autoexec.bat (or you can type it in manually from the MS-DOS
command prompt).<br>
Running the Sound Blaster utility diagnose.exe will automatically
configure<br>
your sound card and put this statement in your autoexec.bat file
for you.<br>
A typical blaster setting looks like this (although yours may
vary):<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 H5
P330 T6<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">If you want to play the
audio track from the CD-ROM while playing Quake,<br>
you must ensure that the audio cable from the CD-ROM is connected
to the<br>
sound card.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">If you don't get sound while
trying to play the audio track, check to see<br>
if a small cable goes from the back of your CD-ROM player
directly to your<br>
sound card. If the CD-ROM audio cable is connected to your sound
board (or<br>
the motherboard in some cases) and you STILL don't hear CD Audio
coming from<br>
your speakers, make sure the MIXER program has the CD volume
turned up.<br>
You will also need to run the CD-ROM driver MSCDEX.EXE. Here is
an example<br>
of the files you should see (yours probably will vary) listed in
your<br>
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT (explanation is in parentheses):<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">CONFIG.SYS:<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">DEVICE=C:\PROSCSI\CDROM.SYS
/D:PROCD01 (CD-ROM driver)<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">AUTOEXEC.BAT:<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 H5
P330 T6 (sound environment variable setting)<br>
C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND\MSCDEX.EXE /D:PROCD01 /L:D (CD-ROM driver)<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Mouse Setup<br>
-----------<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">If you are going to use a
mouse when playing Quake, you will need to load<br>
your mouse driver. This should go in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file as
well. Here<br>
is an example:<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">C:\LOGITECH\MOUSE\MOUSE.EXE
(mouse driver)<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Booting Clean<br>
-------------<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">If you are going to be
running Quake with only 8 megabytes of RAM, it is best<br>
to boot clean . You eliminate unwanted utilities or applications
from taking<br>
up valuable memory, without having to alter your regular
AUTOEXEC.BAT and<br>
CONFIG.SYS. Booting clean can be done in one of two ways. If you
have<br>
MS-DOS version 6.xx, booting clean is as simple a pressing the
shift key<br>
when you see the words &quot;Starting MS-DOS&quot;. If you have
MS-DOS ver 5.xx you<br>
will need to make a system disk.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">To make a boot disk, type
the following from the MS-DOS command prompt:<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">FORMAT A: /S<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">1. Make sure that this is a
disk you wish to erase.<br>
2. This disk absolutely HAS to be formatted in the A: drive.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">To use the system disk,
place the disk in the A: drive and reset the<br>
computer.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">NOTE: If your sound card
requires a driver to be loaded, or you will be<br>
using a mouse, or you will be using Quake's CD audio feature, the
system<br>
disk will need to have a CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT that load
the<br>
appropriate drivers.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Creating a Quake Shortcut<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">As an alternative to making
a Boot Disk, Windows 95 users can create a<br>
Quake Shortcut. By double clicking onthis shortcut, Windows 95
will reboot<br>
in MS-DOS mode and install only the desired drivers, giving you
the same<br>
results as using a Boot Disk. To create a Quake Shortcut, do the
following:<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">1. Using Explorer, right
click and drag the file QUAKE.EXE, from the Quake<br>
directory, to your desktop. Windows 95 will make an MS-DOS Icon
titled<br>
&quot;Shortcut to quake&quot;.<br>
2. Right click on the new icon, and from the menu that pops up,
choose<br>
&quot;Properties&quot;. Then choose the &quot;Program&quot; tab
at the top.<br>
3. Now click on the &quot;Advanced...&quot; button near the
bottom. The &quot;Advanced<br>
Program Settings&quot; window should appear.<br>
4. Select the &quot;MS-DOS mode&quot; check box and the
&quot;Specify a new MS-DOS<br>
configuration&quot; option button.<br>
5. Now simply fill in the &quot;CONFIG.SYS for MS-DOS mode:&quot;
and &quot;AUTOEXEC.BAT<br>
for MS-DOS mode:&quot; boxes with the same sound, CD-ROM and
mouse settings as<br>
mentioned above in the Boot Disks section.<br>
6. Click on &quot;OK&quot; when you are finished. If you wish,
you can change your<br>
Quake Shortcut Icon to something a little more exciting by
clicking on<br>
&quot;Change Icon...&quot;.<br>
7. To finish, click on &quot;OK&quot; again.<br>
8. You can rename your Quake Shortcut by right clicking on the
shortcut<br>
icon, choosing &quot;Rename&quot; and typing in the new name.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">======================================================<br>
== Known Problems ==<br>
======================================================<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Problem: Zombies sometime
get stuck on the ground and connot get back up.<br>
(You can still hear them, but you cannot kill them. This bug
makes it<br>
impossible to get 100% kills on whatever level it occurs on.)<br>
Solution: There is no workaround for this bug.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Problem: It is sometimes
possible for the player to get stuck in a room or<br>
in a wall.<br>
Solution: If you get stuck, use the 'kill' console command. It is
a good<br>
idea to save your game often.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Problem: View centering
problems. Sometimes during a game, the view will not<br>
center properly. The end result is the player view looking up
torwards the<br>
ceiling while walking.<br>
Solution: Exit to the next level or use the 'kill' console
command..<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">======================================================<br>
== Troubleshooting ==<br>
======================================================<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">If Quake fails to start up,
or has problems not addressed elsewhere in the<br>
documentation, try the -safe command line switch, which disables
a number<br>
of parts of Quake that can be problems if there are hardware or
configuration<br>
problems. The -safe command line switch is equivalent to -stdvid,
-nosound,<br>
-nonet, and -nocdaudio together. Those four switches do the
following:<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">-stdvid: disables VESA video
modes.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">-nosound: disables sound
card support.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">-nonet: disables network
card support.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">-nocdaudio: disables CD
audio support.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">If -safe makes the problem
go away, try using each of the switches<br>
individually to isolate the area in which you're experiencing the
problem,<br>
then either correct the configuration or hardware problem or play
Quake with<br>
that functionality disabled.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">If you still have problems,
try booting clean in conjunction with<br>
the -safe command line parameter. For information on booting
clean, refer<br>
to the &quot;Booting Clean&quot; section above.<br>
