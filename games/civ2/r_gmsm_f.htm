        great under Windows 3.1 or Windows 95 with a suggested
        minimum of a 486 DX2/66 with 2X CD ROM and 8 MB RAM. I
        found that the game worked just as well with a 486 SX/66,
        but I would strongly recommend a 4X CD ROM so that the
        video flow is smoother and faster. As well, if you have
        16 MB RAM you'll be in luck since an optional graphics
        program is available to you. With 16 RAM the game will
        show you a virtual representation of your human rivals
        and allies and an </td>
        <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="190" height="346">indication
        of their relative wealth and power. If you're like me and
        aren't fortunate enough to have this much power under the
        hood, don't worry; the game is just as exciting without
        it. <p><b>Summary:</b></p>
        <p><b>The Case For:</b> Improved everything, with the
        playability of the first game intact.</p>
        <p><b>The Case Against</b>: Playability may make your
        employer suspicious of the amount of time you call in </p>
