        form of digital DNA that allows silicon life forms to
        react and behave as if really alive. The resultant

        &quot;It is the artificial intelligence and subsequent
        element of unpredictability,&quot; answers Leps.

        Creatures with overactive hormones,&quot; says Leps.
