        here; however, there are still plenty of buildings to
        destroy and soldiers to kill. Krush is a real-time
        strategy war game whose plot begins like many other
        stories of love and war, with a nuclear holocaust. Two
        groups survived: the Survivors and the Evolved. The
        Survivors fled underground and waited for Mother Nature
        to take Earth out of the microwave. The Evolved remained
        on the surface and mutated like Momma Nat's TV dinners.
        Now the </td>
        <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="190" height="346">radiation
        has subsided and the Survivors want to reclaim the
        surface. Like WarCraft, the two sides have their
        differences, but they are roughly equivalent in strength.
        The Survivors rely more heavily on technology, while the
        Evolved rely on their mutated abilities. Both are
        fighting for control of the land and its only resource:
        oil.<p><img src="../../images/spacer.gif" width="27"

        SVGA graphics.</p>

        <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="190" height="346">well
        drawn and easily discernible from each other. This is
        impressive considering there are over 30 different combat
        groupings. Sound is also good, and it accentuates the
        well-animated carnage and explosions. During the campaign
        games, missions are generally presented via video from
        your commanding officer, accompanied by various charts,
        graphics, and information. The video quality is good, but
        don't neglect the other screens or you'll miss a lot of
        funny, if usually worthless information.<a
