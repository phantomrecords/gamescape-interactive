        <p>Quake<br>
        <br>
        If Doom gets three stars so does Quake. And if I have to
        say one more thing about Quake I'll scream! It's just
        Doom! No matter what you say, how you cut it, Quake is
        Doom reincarnated like Jason or Freddy. And now there's
        millions of Quake-Doom alikes! There's Final Doom,
        Ultimate Doom, Doom 95, Doom II, and Doom Unleashed, Doom
        the 13th, Quake Goes To Hell (okay maybe those last two
        are made up). Sounds to me like somebody sold the Doom
        rights to the world's hungriest marketing company! Enough
        is enough! I mean the play is not anything special if you
        ask me. Personally I like Doom I better than Doom II and
        Quake. The coolest thing about playing Doom is not the
        creatures, it's the background music. The music is cool.
        Everyone knows that. Even when anti-gamers see someone
        playing it they crowd up say &quot;hey that music is
        cool.&quot; So what's Quake got? Music? It didn't strike
        my &quot;cool cord.&quot; Maybe you'll disagree or
        perhaps you didn't play the first Doom. Either way you
        can get the demo here if you like (it's huge though and
        by the time you finish downloading hell might freeze
        over). When you get it you'll basically see a darker
        version of Doom. Why not just get Doom and then search
        the net for the infinite alternative worlds you play for
        that one. I've played the Barney one, Simpsons one, and I
        hear there's Beavis and Buthead and Star Wars world. In
        the Star Wars one you get a lightsaber! There's like a
        new Doom world made every 10 seconds or someting! And
        before I go... if you don't have anyone else to play
        with, don't waste money buying Quake when you can
        download Doom, Doom II, Hexen, and Descent for free and
        play over online services like Kali for about $40 bucks a
        year or for free on the net-based Doom servers all
        throughout the world. These games will sooth your
        Quakings until the price drops to about $45 dollars. Then
        you can buy for collectors value. <br>
        <br>
        Here's a jump start to sooth your Quakings:<br>
        <br>
        gimme Doom<br>
        gimme Doom II<br>
        gimme Hexen<br>
        gimme Descent<br>
        <br>
        To find the alternative Doom worlds search www.yahoo.com
        for &quot;Doom WADS.&quot; Bye now!<br>
