        reason Diablo is such a great value is it's
        replayability. Every time you start a new game, single or
        multiplayer, the maps of the dungeons are drawn
        differently than they were in the last game. You'll
        probably have different quests as well, because the 5-8
        quests in a given game are pulled randomly from a set of
        around 40 different quests. Finally, the items and
        monsters found in each game will vary. Combine these
        variations with </p>

        choice of three character classes, and you can play
        single player Diablo for quite a while.<p><img
        src="../../images/spacer.gif" width="27" height="15">But
        you may never play single player again once you try out
        Blizzard's free online service, Battle.net. You can play
        endlessly if you want to...playing in teams or hunting
        down other players. And talk about replayability! There
        are hundreds of games going on at once, so if the dungeon
        is picked clean on one, just hop to another game; if the
        Smith doesn't have any good </p>

        game will have not only different players, but also
        different map layouts and different items to be found. <p>If
        you do venture onto Battle.net, beware the Player
        Killers_1;dastardly souls who will kill you for sport or
        to get half your gold and an ear for a trophy! Most
        players on the Battle.net service are helpful to new
        players, including most of the higher-level characters.
