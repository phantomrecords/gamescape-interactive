        somewhere so you can get into your inventory? No. Just
        click the &quot;Inv.&quot; button to open the inventory
        on the right half of the action window, grab the armor,
        and drop it over the the chest of your inventory body.
        Bam. Now you're protected, and the whole while you've
        been able to keep fighting on the other half of the
        screen!<p><img src="../../images/spacer.gif" width="27"

        turn the map on or off with the TAB key, and it will

        <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="190" height="346">your
        efficiency in searching and clearing levels. Unlike maps
        in other games, this one doesn't replace your action
        window: it's just a ghostly overlay that helps you get
        your bearings. You can quickly scan the map to see what
        areas of a level you have missed or to remember where the
        stairs were to the next level. Since map movement and
        character movement are independent, you can look quickly
        over the whole level <i>while you are moving in a
        different direction</i>.</td>

        src="../../images/spacer.gif" width="27" height="15">But
        perhaps my favorite feature is the &quot;belt&quot;, a
        series of instant use slots on screen where you can keep
        scrolls and potions, then simply right-click on one to
        use it. This is a savior in tough battles, because it
        allows you to drink health potions without even a hitch
        in the action. You can also have a spell prepared for use
        and simply right-click in the action window to use it.
        There are so many different things you can do in Diablo,
        but doing them in combination or sequence is <i>so easy
        and intuitive</i> because of the outstanding interface
        design. <a href="r_gzlla_c.htm"><img
