        face="Arial">Character Classes</font></h2>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Fighter</b> <br>
        Of all the regents in Cerilia, fighter regents outnumber
        regents of all other classes. Blooded fighters often set
        out to expand their kingdoms by sheer force. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Paladin</b> <br>
        In Cerilia, paladins are found only among the Anuireans
        and the Khinasi; only characters of these two
        nationalities may choose this class. Anuirean paladins
        choose to serve Haelyn, Cuiracen, or Nesirie. Khinasi
        paladins follow either Halaia (Haelyn) or Avani. The
        paladin's choice of patron affect his particular
        attitudes, spell selections, and powers. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Ranger</b> </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Priest</b> <br>
        Every priest character in a Birthright campaign must
        choose one of the Cerilian powers and abide by the
        allowed weapons, armor, and spheres of access granted to
        priests of that deity. In some cases, these restrictions
        are similar to the standard abilities associated with the
        cleric class, but in other cases, priests may command
        unusual abilities. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Your campaign will begin in the
        Anuire region. Priest characters choosing to be regents
        should select from the powers venerated in Anuire.
        (Nonregent priests can originate anywhere.) Halfling
        priests worship an aspect of Avanalae; the dwarves follow
        the god Moradin. The Sidhelien have no deities at all
        (thus, Cerilian elves cannot be priests). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Wizard</b> <br>
        The lands of Cerilia are inherently magical, and a mage
        with both the right and the knowledge can create wonders
        and terrors with the power the land provides. But true
        mages and high sorcery are quite rare in the Birthright
        campaign, and every sorcerer is a figure of mystery and
        destiny. In all of Cerilia, there are no more than six or
        seven score true mages; less than half that number are
        regents capable of wielding realm magic. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Cerilian mages recognize three
        orders of magic: lesser magic, true magic, and realm
        magic. Any person of sufficient intelligence and training
        can command <i>lesser magic</i> , comprising the arts of
        illusion and divination. These two schools draw upon
        energies that are drastically different and relatively
        weaker than the energies used by the other schools of
        magic. Lesser magic also includes the 1st- and 2nd-level
        spells of the other schools. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><i>True magic</i> includes all
        other schools of wizardry, but only elves, half-elves,
        and blooded humans can command its arcane power. Wizards
        must be born with the stuff of magic in their veins to
        wield spells of 3rd level or higher from all schools of
        magic. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The most powerful enchantments are
        known as <i>realm magic</i>; they are woven from the
        power of the land itself. Only wizards who are regents
        may use these spells; a wizard without the energy
        provided by a sorcerous domain would be destroyed utterly
        if such a spell were attempted. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Any wizard who is capable of
        casting realm magic can also wield true magic and lesser
        magic. Wielders of true magic can also use lesser magic. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Thief</b> </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">As long as a thief regent maintains
        a holding in a province, he can evade arrest
        indefinitely. However, if his holding is reduced to level
        0 or divested, his immunity vanishes. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Bard</b> <br>
        In Cerilia, bards are revered as historians, heralds,
        messengers, and advisers. Their neutrality is respected
        by all but the most barbaric human lands (although the
        elven forests and the lands dominated by awnsheghlien
        pose danger even to bards). The skill and wisdom of a
        court bard is often a great status symbol for a ruler. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Most bards belong to a college,
        which is a loose association rather than a place of
        learning. Each college has its own goals and hidden
        agendas. Bad blood exists between some colleges, but most
        have a friendly or tolerant attitude toward the others. A
        bard's college provides a network of correspondents,
        observers, and allies who look after his interests in
        their own areas-and who expect him to do likewise for
        them. </font></p>
        <h2><font face="Arial">Languages</font></h2>
        <p><font face="Arial">The five human tongues serve as
        localized forms of common in each respective area of
        Cerilia. Some of these languages have ancient or archaic
        forms which scholars study in order to read ancient
        writings. Elvish is the oldest language of Cerilia, and
        has remained remarkably unchanged in thousands of years. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp; </font></p>
        <h2><font face="Arial">Equipment</font></h2>
        <p><font face="Arial">Not all equipment is available
        everywhere. For example, only the Khinasi show a
        preference for curved swords, so scimitars are typically
        sold only in Khinasi cities. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">If a desired weapon isn't available
        in a character's region, the player character must travel
        to that locale, or locate an importer or trader who deals
        in the item and pay a premium for it. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Some weapons and armor have
        characteristics unique to Cerilia; for example, Cerilian
        crossbows are far more powerful and have better damage
        ratings than their counterparts. Special characteristics
        for such equipment are listed as follows: </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Claymore:</b> The claymore was
        developed by the Rjurik to attack the heavy armor worn by
        Anuirean knights. It is a well-balanced, two-handed sword
        of medium length. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Cutlass:</b> Popular among
        seafarers, the cutlass is a heavy, slightly curved,
        single-edged blade with a basket hilt. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Crossbow:</b> In the Birthright
        campaign, crossbows have exceptional penetrating power
        and thus a special advantage against armor. At medium
        range, an armored target is treated as if his AC were two
        points worse than his actual armor class (crossbows gain
        no advantage against unarmored targets). At short range,
        an armored target is treated as if his AC were five
        points worse than his actual armor class. For example, a
        knight in full plate mail is AC 1, but a crossbow fired
        at short range is rolled as if the target were AC 6. A
        wizard wearing bracers of defense AC 4 is treated as AC 4
        against the same shot. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Main-gauche:</b> This parrying
        dagger provides an AC bonus of +1 when wielded by a
        proficient user. It cannot be used to attack in the same
        round in which it is used for defense. If the weapon is
        used for an attack rather than for defense, the AC bonus
        is forfeited. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Rapier:</b> Rapiers are common
        in regions where heavy armor is not conventional. They're
        especially popular in Brechtur. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Sabre:</b> Khinasi cavalrymen
        favor the sabre. Its slightly curved, heavy blade puts
        more weight behind the swing than the lighter blade of a
        scimitar. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Breastplate and Leather:</b>
        Anuirean infantry and pikemen are often equipped with a
        breastplate that is worn over a long, leather coat. The
        steel plate protects the wearer's vitals; leather sleeves
        and leggings provide a small degree of protection for the
        limbs. The entire ensemble costs 80 gp. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Half plate:</b> Elite foot
        troops and most medium and heavy cavalry wear half-plate
        armor, which consists of plate protection for the torso,
        thighs, and lower arms. Whereas plate mail comprises
        plates that are worn over chain mail, half plate
        comprises plates worn over soft leather. Half plate costs
        300 gp. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Improved mail:</b> The Khinasi
        dislike plate armor, but increasing improvements in Vos
        and Anuirean armor have forced the Khinasi to improve
        their chain mail by reinforcing it with small metal bars
        threaded through the links. The Rjurik version of
        improved mail doubles the thickness of normal chain.
        Either version costs 180 gp. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Varsks:</b> The cold wilderness
        of Vosgaard is home to the varsks, a variety of
        white-furred giant lizard domesticated by the Vos. The
        weather and poor forage of lands make it difficult for
        the Vos to keep horses, but varsks are adapted to cold
        weather and can go for as long as two weeks with minimal
        food. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A varsk costs about 250 gp,
        although an outstanding animal might fetch twice that
        price. They are normally available only in Vosgaard,
        since they don't fare well in warmer climates and don't
        get along with horses or other domesticated animals. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Varsks have 30 movement points for
        purposes of overland movement (see Time and Movement in
        the DMG). They can carry riders and loads of up to 240
        pounds without being slowed; up to 360 pounds for
        one-half speed; and up to 480 pounds for one-third speed.
        They're well-adapted to moving over snow and ice, and
        ignore movement penalties in such terrain. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Other Equipment:</b> Adventurers
        depend on all kinds of equipment, rations, and devices of
        convenience and necessity. If a question arises about the
        kinds of technology available, use the following
        approximations. <br>
        * Anuireans, Brechts, Khinasi, elves, and dwarves are the
        equivalent of Renaissance culture. <br>
        * The Rjurik and orogs are the equivalent of Middle Ages
        culture. <br>
        * The Vos, goblins, and gnolls approximate Dark Ages
        technology. </font></p>
