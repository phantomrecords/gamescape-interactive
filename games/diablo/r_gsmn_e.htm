        save one game per character at a time. I think many
        gamers, particularly RPG lovers, might prefer a system
        where they could recall older games, particularly just
        before the player is required to make a
        character-building decision. It would be very convenient
        to save the game just before you spend ability points,
        especially if you got deep into a dungeon and realized
        that extra Dexterity instead of Strength might be
        helpful, or that choosing the super-duper weapon over the

        with their manuals. This one is packed with information,
        including a lengthy background story, descriptions of
        monsters and characters, and lots of useful gameplay
        information. There are four pages on how to setup a
        multiplayer game alone. The manual is also </p>
