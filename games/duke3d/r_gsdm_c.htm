        Suffice to say, bags and bags of imagination has been put

        You start off with the fairly weedy pistol.. okay for
        sniping, but pretty useless if your foe is carrying
        anything bigger than a shotgun. Next comes the
        now-traditional shotgun, enough to see the real cannon
        fodder of the game with one or two shots. Then you get
        the Ripper, a chaingun, good for most things as long it
        doesn't chuck missiles. Up one from that, there's the RPG
        , your standard or garden rocket launcher, good for
        groups of baddies, or the bigger monsties.</td>

        territory, pretty much, until you get to the next bit of
        hardware, the pipebomb. Now this is more like it. These
        things are compact explosives which can be lobbed round ,
        and detonated at will. You can also set up several
        pipebombs, and set them all off at once. Great for nuking
        trailing baddies, or for Dukematch suprises. BUT, and
        this is bit of a prob, if you walk into them, you pick
        them up automatically. Arrrgh! Your pipebomb minefields
        can be ruined, just by <a href="r_gsdm_d.htm"><img
