        the game are under the player's control, including the
        gender and &quot;attitude&quot; of the dealer (dealer
        voices are possible in CD mode only). This includes the
        feeling of helplessness and shame when one loses over
        $500,000 of hard earned cash on a single bet (I needed a
        six, I got a seven). You can play by the rules of a
        number of different cities, including Vegas and Atlantic
        City. And what gambling game would be complete without
        the ever present lure of the ATM? Really the only thing

        since its inception, the perfect game for people stuck at
        home with the flu. The Hoyle version includes 28
        different games. Among these are Klondike, Poker Square
        (personal fave), Pyramid, and Canfield. An on-line
        tutorial makes it easy to learn each game, regardless of
        whether or not you've ever played before. </p>

        can quickly become a minor obsession. After running
        through all 28 games, I found myself running through all
        28 again...and again...and again. This game is ADDICTIVE.
        With a capital ADDICT. I got a raging flu right after
        receiving the game, so the fact that my butt was glued to
        the chair for four days had little impact on my social
        life. You may not be so lucky... <p><img
