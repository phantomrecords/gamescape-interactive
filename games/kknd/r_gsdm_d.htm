        instead of putting up with a huge status bar that eats
        away a quarter of the right side of the screen, <b><i>KKnD</i></b>square
        uses small buttons that then extend into more buttons
        when you click on one. This stands as a major
        organisation improvement - I would often waste valuable
        seconds (even minutes!) scrolling through the endless
        list of units/structures in <b><i>RA</i></b>. This was
        due to the game only being able to display 4 of the items
        on screen at once, in just 2 columns, out of a huge range
        of 20 or more. The buttons in </td>
        <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="190" height="346"><b><i>KKnD</i></b>
        are divided into three sections (infantry, vehicles,
        buildings), and practically all options can be displayed
        at once, making implementation of building new units and
        structures a much quicker process. Additionally, by
        holding the right mouse button and dragging the mouse,
        you can 'quick scroll' all around the map, which is very
        handy when you have no radar.<p><img

        though, there were many things missed out that severely
        decreases the interface's ease of use, and forces you to
        spend more time </p>

        directing troops, instead of using careful planning and
        thinking up new strategies. These include: not being able
        to send multiple troops in for repair, no visual
        confirmation when assigning groups to a number, can't
        'bookmark' areas on the map, no troop commands like
        'Guard', 'Formation', 'Patrol' and 'Protect' as
        implemented in <b><i>RA</i></b>, and finally, no option
        to 'Force Move' so running over and squishing enemy
        troops can only be accomplished by commanding big
        vehicles to move somewhere <i>beyond</i> them <a
