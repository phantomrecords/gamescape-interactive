        are those who combine bravery with skill. The Warrior is
        highly trained and prepared to descend to the depths of
        Hell in search of fame or perhaps honour. Often the
        Warrior will take on Quests of charity to free innocent
        folk from the hazards that haunt humanity in these times
        of dark magic. The Warrior is the strongest of the three
        classes as he excels at the art of close combat. His
        primary weakness is that his extensive physical training
        has left little time to develop more than a rudimentary
        knowledge of magic. The extended periods of time that
        most Warriors spend away from their homes and
        civilisation requires that they learn to repair their own
        weapons and armour, although their skill is no match for
        the talent of a true Blacksmith. Nonetheless the Warrior
        can restore a weapons durability at small cost to the
        overall life of the item. When times are harsh and funds
        are low, this trade-off is far preferable to the possible
        expensive choice of a Blacksmith's repair, especially for
        magical items and armour.</font></td>

        Sleek with beauty or the bow is the Rogue. Also known as
        the Sisters of the Sightless Eye, these are a loosely
        organized guild shrouded in mystery among the peoples of
        the West. Those in Tristram have been seeing much more of
        elusive Rogue since the death of King Laoric and the
        rumours of wealth in the dungeon began to surface. These
        highly skilled archers employ ancient Eastern
        philosophies that develop an &quot;inner-sight&quot; that
        they use both in combat and to circumvent dangerous traps
        that they may encounter. Known only as wandering Rogues
        in the West, the Sisters conceal their secret affiliation
        by posing as simple travelers. Many pompous fools have
        made the mistake of underestimating these steel nerved
        women in combat and paid a terrible price for their
        vanity. Although not as powerful in close combat as the
        Warrior, the Rogue is the master of the bow. A killed
        Sister can cut down a horde of rushing demons before they
        even reach arm's length. The Rogue is the choice of the
        thoughtful player.</font></td>

        The Sorcerer has always been a controversial character
        choice for the realms of battle. While neither possessing
        great strength nor prowess of weapon the Sorcerer is the
        only class that can destroy entire maps of Hellish
        denizens from a single standing location. When used
        wisely the combination of spells and traps set by the
        Sorcerer can spell death for lurking creatures far away.
        This is often achieved by sending Golems, Guardians, and
        other minions of Light to do the bidding of the Sorcerer
        themselves. The possibility of discovering long lost
        tomes of unknown magic has attracted magicians of both
        youth and age to descend into the dungeon in search of
        enlightenment and reward. If you choose to travel as the
        Sorcerer be wary that the true nature of magic does not
        fully bloom until very high levels of skill indeed
        nearing the 20s or 30s.</font></td>

        pieces is nothing next to the added value an identified

        to imply he has had extended experiences with Griswold.
        It also seems evident that those experiences have led to
        crumble to the drunken state in which he now exists.</font></td>

        increased potency also require fewer units of Mana making
        it possible to actually cast more of them, doing more
